<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">BEFORE THE GALILEE</p>

<p class="p1">WHAT was the world coming to? The world—the centre of it—the Isle of
Ely?</p>

<p>What aged man in his experience through
threescore years and ten had heard of such
conduct before?</p>

<p>What local poet, whose effusions appeared
in the 'Cambridge and Ely Post,' in his wildest
flights of imagination, conceived of such a
thing?</p>

<p>Decency must have gone to decay and been
buried. Modesty must have unfurled her wings
and sped to heaven before such an event could
become possible.</p>

<p>Where were the constables? Were bye-laws
to become dead letters? Were order, propriety,
the eternal fitness of things, to be trampled under
foot by vagabonds?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of the cathedral, before the Galilee,—the
magnificent west porch of the minster of
St. Etheldreda,—a Cheap Jack's van was drawn
up.</p>

<p>Within twenty yards of the Bishop's palace,
where every word uttered was audible in every
room, a Cheap Jack was offering his wares.</p>

<p>Effrontery was, in heraldic language, rampant
and regardant.</p>

<p>A crowd was collected about the van; a
crowd composed of all sorts and conditions
of men, jostling each other, trampling on the
grass of the lawn, climbing up the carved
work of the cathedral, to hear, to see, to bid,
to buy.</p>

<p>Divine service was hardly over. The organ
was still mumbling and tooting, when through
the west door came a drift of choristers, who
had flung off their surplices and had raced down
the nave, that they might bid against and outbid
each other for the pocket-knives offered by
Cheap Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. Faggs, the beadle, was striding in the
same direction, relaxing the muscles of his face
from the look of severe ecclesiastical solemnity
into which they were drawn during divine
worship. It had occurred to him during the
singing of the anthem that there were sundry
articles of domestic utility Cheap Jack was
selling that it might be well for him to secure at
a low figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bowles, the chief bailiff, had come forth
from evensong with his soul lifted up with
thankfulness that he was not as other men were:
he attended the cathedral daily, he subscribed
to all the charities; and now he stood looking on,
his breath taken away, his feet riveted to the
soil by surprise at the audacity of the Cheap
Jack, in daring to draw up before the minster,
and vend his wares during the hour of afternoon
prayer.</p>

<p>The servant maids in the canons' houses in
the Close had their heads craned out from such
narrow Gothic windows as would allow their
brachycephalic skulls to pass, and were listening
and lawk-a-mussying and oh-mying over the
bargains.</p>

<p>Nay, the Bishop himself was in an upper room,
the window-sash of which was raised, ensconced
behind the curtain, with his ear open and cocked,
and he was laughing at what he heard till his
apron rippled, his bald head waxed pink, and
his calves quivered.</p>

<p>Very little of the sides of the van was visible,
so encrusted were they with brooms, brushes,
door-mats, tin goods, and coalscuttles. Between
these articles might be detected the glimmer of
the brimstone yellow of the carcase of the shop
on wheels. The front of the conveyance was
open; it was festooned with crimson plush
curtains, drawn back; and, deep in its depths
could be discerned racks and ranges of shelves,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>

stored with goods of the most various and
inviting description.</p>

<p>The front of the van was so contrived as to
fall forward, and in so falling to disengage a pair
of supports that sustained it, and temporarily
converted it into a platform. On this platform
stood the Cheap Jack, a gaunt man with bushy
dark hair and sunken cheeks; he was speaking
with a voice rendered hoarse by bellowing. He
was closely shaven. He wore drab breeches and
white stockings, a waistcoat figured with flowers,
and was in his shirt sleeves. On his head was
a plush cap, with flaps that could be turned up
or down as occasion served. When turned down,
that in front was converted into a peak that
sheltered his eyes, those at the sides protected
his ears, and that behind prevented rain from
coursing down the nape of his neck. When,
however, these four lappets were turned up, they
transformed the cap into a crown—a crown such
as it behoved the King of Cheap Jacks to wear.
The man was pale and sallow, sweat-drops stood
on his brow, and it was with an effort that he
maintained the humour with which he engaged
the attention of his hearers, and that he made
his voice audible to those in the outermost ring
of the curious and interested clustered about the
van. Within, in the shadowed depths of the
conveyance, glimpses were obtained of a girl,
who moved about rapidly and came forward
occasionally to hand the Cheap Jack such articles

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

as he demanded, or to receive from him such as
had failed to command a purchaser.</p>

<p>When she appeared, it was seen that she was
a slender, well-built girl of about seventeen
summers, with ripe olive skin, a thick head of
short-cut chestnut hair, and a pair of hazel
eyes.</p>

<p>Apparently she was unmoved by her father's
jokes; they provoked no smile on her lips, for
they were familiar to her; and she was equally
unmoved by the admiration she aroused among
the youths, with which also she was apparently
familiar.</p>

<p>'Here now!' shouted the Cheap Jack. 'What
the dickens have I got?—a spy-glass to be sure,
and such a spy-glass as never was and never will
be offered again. When I was a-comin' along
the road from Cambridge, and was five miles
off, "Tear and ages!" sez I, seein' your famous
cathedral standin' up in the sunshine, "Tear
and ages!" sez I; "that's a wonder of the world."
And I up wi' my spy-glass. Now look here.
You observe as 'ow one of the western wings be
fallen down. 'Tis told that when the old men
built up that there top storey to the tower, that
it throwed the left wing down. Now I looked
through this perspective glass, and I seed both
wings standing just as they used to be, and just
as they ought to be, but ain't. I couldn't take
less than seventeen and six for this here wonderful
spy-glass—seventeen and six. What! not buy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>

a glass as will show you how things ought to be,
but ain't?' He turned to the circle round him
from side to side. 'Come now,—say ten
shillings. 'Tis a shame to take the perspective
glass out of Ely.' A pause. 'No one inclined
to bid ten shillings? Take it back, Zita. These
here Ely folk be that poor they can't go above
tenpence. Ten shillings soars above their
purses. But stay. Zita, give me that there
glass again. There is something more that is
wonderful about it. You look through and you'll
see what's to your advantage, and that's what
every one don't see wi' the naked eye. Come—say
seven shillings!'</p>

<p>No bid.</p>

<p>'And let me tell the ladies—they've but to
look through, and they'll see the <em>him</em> they've set
their 'arts on, comin', comin',—bloomin' as a rose,
and 'olding the wedding ring in 'is 'and.'</p>

<p>In went the heads of the servant maids of the
canons' residences.</p>

<p>'I say!' shouted one of the choristers, 'will it
show us a coming spanking?'</p>

<p>'Of course it will,' answered the Cheap Jack,
'because it's to your advantage.'</p>

<p>'Let us look then.'</p>

<p>Cheap Jack handed the telescope to the lad.
He put his eye to it, drew the glass out, lowered
it, and shouted, 'I see nothing.'</p>

<p>'Of course not. You're such a darlin' good
boy; you ain't going to have no spanking.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>'Let me look,' said a shop-girl standing by.</p>

<p>Cheap Jack waited. Every one watched.</p>

<p>'I don't see nothing,' said the girl.</p>

<p>'Of course not. You ain't got a sweetheart,
and never will have one.'</p>

<p>A roar of laughter, and the young woman
retired in confusion.</p>

<p>'And, I say,' observed the boy, as he returned
the glass, 'it's all a cram about the fallen transept.
I looked, and saw it was down.'</p>

<p>'Of course you did,' retorted the Cheap Jack.
'Didn't I say five miles off? Go five miles
along the Wisbeach Road, and you'll see it
sure enough, as I said. There—five shillings
for it.'</p>

<p>'I'll give you half a crown.'</p>

<p>'Half a crown!' jeered the vendor. 'There,
though, you're a quirister, and for the sake o'
your beautiful voice, and because you're such
a good boy, as don't deserve nor expect a
whacking, you shall have it for half a crown.'</p>

<p>The Bishop's nose and one eye were thrust
from behind the curtain.</p>

<p>'Why,' said the Right Reverend to himself,
'that's Tom Bulk, as mischievous a young
rogue as there is in the choir and grammar
school. He is as sure of a caning this week as—as'—</p>

<p>'Thanky, sir,' said Cheap Jack, pocketing the
half-crown. 'Zita, what next? Hand me that
blazin' crimson plush weskit.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>From out the dark interior stepped the girl,
and the sunshine flashed over her, lighting her
auburn hair, rich as burnished copper. She
wore a green, scarlet, and yellow flowered kerchief,
tied across her bosom, and knotted behind
her back. Bound round her waist was a white
apron.</p>

<p>She deigned no glance at the throng, but
kept her eyes fixed on her father's face.</p>

<p>'Are you better, dad?' she asked in a low
tone.</p>

<p>'Not much, Zit. But I'll go through with it.'</p>

<p>'Here we are now!' shouted the Jack, after
he had drawn the sleeve of his left arm across
his brow and lips, that were bathed in perspiration.
And yet the weather was cold; the
season was the end of October, and the occasion
of the visit of the van to Ely was Tawdry (St.
Etheldreda's) Fair.</p>

<p>A whisper and nudges passed among the
young men crowded about the van.</p>

<p>'Ain't she just a stunner?'</p>

<p>'I say, I wish the Cheap Jack would put up
the girl to sale. Wouldn't there be bidding?'</p>

<p>'She's the finest thing about the caravan.'</p>

<p>Such were comments that flew from one to
another.</p>

<p>'Now, then!' bellowed the vendor of cheap
wares; 'here you are again! A red velvet
weskit, with splendid gold—real gold—buttons.
You shall judge; I'll put it on.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The man suited the action to the word. Then
he straightened his legs and arms, and turned
himself about from side to side to exhibit the
full beauty of the vestment from every quarter.</p>

<p>'Did you ever see the like of this?' he shouted.
'But them breeches o' mine have a sort o'
deadening effect on the beauty of the weskit.
Thirty shillings is the price. You should see it
along with a black frock-coat and black trousers.
Then it's glorious! It's something you can
wear with just what you likes. No one looks
at rags when you've this on, so took up is they
with the weskit. What is that you said, sir?
Twenty-five shillings was your offer? It is
yours—and all because I sees it'll go with them
great black whiskers of yours like duck and
green peas. It'll have a sort of a mellering effect
on their bushiness, and 'armonise with them as
well as the orging goes wi' the chanting of the
quiristers.'</p>

<p>Jack handed the waistcoat, which he had
hastily plucked off his back, to one of the layclerks
of the cathedral. The man turned as
red as the waistcoat, and thrust his hands
behind his back.</p>

<p>'I never bid for it,' he protested.</p>

<p>'Beg pardon, sir; I thought you nodded your
'ead to me, but it was the wind a-blowin' of it
about. That gentleman with the black flowin'
whiskers don't take the weskit; it is still for
sale. I'll let you have it for fifteen shillings,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

and it'll make you a conquering hero among
the females. You, sir? Here you are.'</p>

<p>He addressed the chief bailiff, Mr. Bowles, an
elderly, white-whiskered, semi-clerical official,
the pink and paragon of propriety.</p>

<p>'No!' exclaimed Cheap Jack, as Mr. Bowles,
with uplifted palms and averted head, staggered
back. 'No—his day is past. But I can see by
the twinkle of his eye he was the devil among
the gals twenty years ago. It's the young chaps
who must compete for the weskit. I'll tell you
something rare,' continued the man, after clearing
his throat and mopping his brow and lips.
'No one will think but what you're a lord or a
harchbishop when you 'ave this 'ere weskit on.
As I was a-coming into Ely in this here concern,
sez I to myself, "I'll put on an appearance out
o' respect to this ancient and venerable city."
So I drawed on this weskit; and what should
'appen but we meets his most solemn and sacred
lordship, the Bishop of the diocese.'</p>

<p>'This is coming it rather strong,' said the
person alluded to behind the curtain, and his
face and head became hot and damp.</p>

<p>'Well, and when his lordship, the Right
Reverend, saw me, he lifted up his holy eyes
and looked at my weskit. And then sez he to
himself, "Lawk-a-biddy, it's the Prince!" and
down he went in the dirt afore me, grovellin'
with his nose in the mire. He did, upon my
word.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>'Upon my word, this is monstrous! this is
insufferable! A joke is a joke!' gasped the
Bishop, very much agitated. 'There's moderation
in all things—a limitation to be observed
even in exaggeration. I haven't been on the
Wisbeach Road this fortnight. I never saw the
man. I never went down in the dirt. This is
positively appalling!'</p>

<p>He took a turn round the room, went to the
bell, then considered that it would be inadvisable
to summon the footman and show that he
had been listening to the nonsense of a Cheap
Jack. Accordingly he went back to the window,
hid himself once more behind the curtain, but
so trembled with excitement and distress, that
the whole curtain trembled with him.</p>

<p>'Nine and six. Here you are. Nine and six
for this splendid garment, and cheap it is—dirt
cheap. You're a lucky man, sir; and won't you
only cut out your rivals with the darling?'</p>

<p>Cheap Jack handed the plush waistcoat to a
young farmer from the Fens; then suddenly he
turned himself about, looked into his van, and
said in a husky voice—</p>

<p>'Zit, I can't go yarning no longer. I've got
to the end of my powers; you carry on.'</p>

<p>'Right, father; I'm the boy for you with the
general public.'</p>

<p>The man stepped within. As he did so, the
girl lowered one of the curtains so as to conceal
him. He sank wearily on a bench at the side.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

She stooped with a quivering lip and filling eye
and kissed him, then sprang forward and stood
outside on the platform, contemplating the
crowd with a look of assurance, mingled with
contempt.</p>

<p class="center">THE FLAILS</p>

<p class="p1">'NOW, here's a chance you may never have
again—a chance, let me tell you, you
never <em>will</em> have again.' She extended in both
hands packages of tea done up in silvered paper.
'The general public gets cheated in tea—it does—tremenjous!
It is given sloe leaves, all kinds
of rubbish, and pays for it a fancy price. Father,
he has gone and bought a plantation out in
China, and has set over it a real mandarin with
nine tails, and father guarantees that this tea
is the very best of our plantation teas, and he
sells it at a price which puts it within the reach
of all. Look here!' she turned a parcel about;
'here you are, with the mandarin's own seal
upon it, to let every one know it is genuine,
and that it is the only genuine tea sent over.'</p>

<p>'Where's the plantation, eh, girl?' jeered a
boy from the grammar school.</p>

<p>'Where is it?' answered the girl, turning
sharply on her interlocutor. 'It's at Fumchoo.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>

Do you know where Fumchoo is? You don't?
and yet you sets up to be a scholar. It is fifteen
miles from Pekin by the high road, and seven
and a half over the fields. Go to school and
look at your map, and tell your master he ought
to be ashamed of himself not to ha' made you
know your geography better. Now, then, here's
your chance. Finest orange-flower Pekoe at
four shillings. Beat that if you can.' No offers.
'I am not coming down in my price. Don't
think that; not a farthing. Four shillings a
pound; but I'll try to meet you in another way.
I keep the tea in quarter-pound parcels as well.
Perhaps that'll meet your views—and a beautiful
pictur' of Fumchoo on the cover, with the
Chinamen a-picking of the tea leaves. What!
no bidder?'</p>

<p>There ensued a pause. Every one expected
that the girl would lower the price. They were
mistaken. She went back into the van and
produced a roll of calico. Then ensued an
outcry of many voices: 'Tea! give us some of
your tea, please.' In ten minutes she had disposed
of all she had.</p>

<p>'There, you see,' said Zita, 'our supply runs
short. In Wisbeach the Mayor and Corporation
bought it, and at Cambridge all the colleges
had their supplies from us. That's why we're
run out now. Stand back, gents.'</p>

<p>This call was one of caution to the eager
purchasers and tempted lookers-on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Tawdry Fair was for horses and bullocks,
and a drove of the latter was being sent along
from the market-place towards Stuntney. For
a while the business of the sale was interrupted.
One audacious bullock even bounded into the
Galilee, another careered round the van; one
ran as if for sanctuary to the Bishop's palace.
Zita seized the occasion to slip inside the van.
Her father was on the low seat, leaning his head
wearily on his hand, and his elbow on his knee.</p>

<p>'How are you now, dad?'</p>

<p>'I be bad, Zit—bad—tremenjous.'</p>

<p>'Had you not best see a doctor?'</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'It'll pass,' said he; 'I reckon doctors won't
do much for me. They're over much like us
Cheap Jacks—all talk and trash.'</p>

<p>'This has been coming on some time,'
observed the girl gravely. 'I've seen for a
fortnight you have been poorly.'</p>

<p>Then, looking forth between the curtains
which she had lowered, she saw that the
bullocks were gone, and that the cluster of
people interested in purchases had re-formed
round her little stage.</p>

<p>'I say,' shouted a chorister, 'have you got
any pocket-knives?'</p>

<p>'Pocket-knives by the score, and razors too.
You'll be wanting a pair of them in a fortnight.'</p>

<p>Whilst Zita was engaged in furnishing the
lads with knives, the Bishop retired from the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

upstairs window to his library, where he seated
himself in an easy-chair, took up a pamphlet,
and went up like a balloon inflated with elastic
gas into theologic clouds, where controversy
flashed and thundered about his head, and in
this, his favourite sphere, the Right Reverend
Father forgot all about the Cheap Jack, and no
longer felt concern at his having been misrepresented
as grovelling before a prince of the
blood royal in a red waistcoat.</p>

<p>At the same time, also, a plot concerning Zita
was being entered into by a number of young
fen-men who had come to Tawdry Fair to amuse
themselves, and had been arrested by the attractions
of the Cheap Jack's van.</p>

<p>Whatever those attractions might have been
whilst the man was salesman, they were
enhanced tenfold when his place was occupied
by his daughter. Some whispering had gone
on for five minutes, and then with one consent
they began to elbow their way forward till they
had formed an innermost ring around the
platform. But this centripetal movement had
not been executed without difficulty and protest.
Women, boys, burly men were forced to give
way before the wedge-like thrusts inwards of
the young men's shoulders, and they remonstrated,
the women shrilly, the boys by shouts,
the men with oaths and blows. But every sort
of resistance was overcome, all remonstrances
of whatever sort were disregarded, and Zita

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

suddenly found herself surrounded by a circle
of sturdy, tall fellows, looking up with faces
expressive of mischief.</p>

<p>That something more than eagerness to
purchase was at the bottom of this movement
struck Zita, and for a moment she lost confidence,
and faltered in her address on the
excellence of some moth-eaten cloth she was
endeavouring to sell.</p>

<p>Then one round-faced, apple-complexioned
young man worked himself up by the wheel
of the van, and, planting his elbows on the
platform, shouted, 'Come, my lass, at what
price do you sell kisses?'</p>

<p>'We ha'n't got them in the general stock,'
answered Zita; 'but I'll ask father if he'll give
you one.'</p>

<p>A burst of laughter.</p>

<p>'No, no,' shouted the red-faced youth, getting
one knee on the stage. 'I'll pay you sixpence
for a kiss—slick off your cherry lips.'</p>

<p>'I don't sell.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll have one as a gift.'</p>

<p>'I never give away nothing.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll steal one.'</p>

<p>The young fellow jumped to his feet on the
platform. At the signal the rest of the youths
began to scramble up, and in a minute the place
was invaded, occupied, and the girl surrounded.
Cheers and roars of laughter rose from the
spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now, then, you Cheap Jack girl,' exclaimed
the apple-faced youth. 'Kisses all round, three
a-piece, or we'll play Old Harry with the shop,
and help ourselves to its contents.'</p>

<p>The father of Zita, on hearing the uproar,
the threats, the tramp of boots on the stage,
staggered to his feet, and, drawing back the
curtains, stood holding them apart, and looking
forth with bewildered eyes. Zita turned and
saw him.</p>

<p>'Sit down, father,' said she. 'It's only the
general public on a frolic.'</p>

<p>She put her hand within and drew forth a
stout ashen flail, whirled it about her head, and
at once, like grasshoppers, the youths leaped
from the stage, each fearing lest the flapper
should fall on and cut open his own pate.
The last to spring was the apple-faced youth;
he was endeavouring to find some free space
into which to descend, when the flapper of the
flail came athwart his shoulder-blades with so
sharp a stroke, that, uttering a howl, he plunged
among the throng, and would have knocked
down two or three, had they not been wedged
together too closely to be upset.</p>

<p>Then ensued cries from those hurt by his
weight as he floundered upon them; cries of
'Now, then, what do you mean by this? Can't
you keep to yourself? This comes of your
nonsense.'</p>

<p>Zita stood erect, leaning on the staff of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>

flail, looking calmly round on the confusion,
waiting till the uproar ceased, that she might
resume business. As she thus stood, her eye
rested on a tall, well-shaped man, with a tiger's
skin cast over his broad shoulders, and with a
black felt slouched hat on his head. His nose
was like the beak of a hawk. His eyes were
dark, piercing, and singularly close together,
under brows that met in one straight band
across his forehead.</p>

<p>The moment this man's eye caught that of
Zita, he raised his great hat, flourished it in
the air, exposing a shaggy head with long dark
locks, and he shouted, 'Well done, girl! I like
that. Give me a pair of them there ashen flails,
and here's a crown for your pluck.'</p>

<p>'I haven't a pair,' said the girl.</p>

<p>'Then I'll have that one, with which a little
gal of sixteen has licked our Fen louts. I like
that.'</p>

<p>'I'll give you a crown for that flail,' called
another man, from the farther side of the crowd.
'Here you are—a crown.'</p>

<p>This man was fair, with light whiskers—a
tall man as well as the other, and about the
same age.</p>

<p>'I'll give you seven shillings and six—a
crown and half a crown for that flail,' roared
the dark man. 'I bid first—I want that flail.'</p>

<p>'Two crowns—ten shillings,' called the fair
man. 'I can make a better offer than Drownlands—

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

not as I want the flail, but as Drownlands
wants it, he shan't have it.'</p>

<p>'Twelve and six,' roared the dark man.
'Gold's no object with me. What I wants I
will have.'</p>

<p>The lookers-on nudged each other. A young
farmer said to his fellow, 'Them chaps, Runham
and Drownlands, be like two tigers; when they
meet they must fight. We shall have fun.'</p>

<p>'You are a fool!' shouted the fair man,—'a
fool—that is what I think you are, to give
twelve and six for what isn't worth two shillings.
I'll let you have it at that price, that you may
become the laughing-stock of the Fens.'</p>

<p>The flail was handed out of the van to the
man called Drownlands, Zita received a piece
of gold and half a crown in her palm. She
retired into the waggon, and immediately reappeared
with a second flail.</p>

<p>'Here is another, after all,' said she; 'I didn't
think I had it.'</p>

<p>'I'll take that to make the pair,' said Drownlands;
'but as you've done me over the first,
I think you should give me this one.'</p>

<p>'I done you!' exclaimed Zita; 'you've done
yourself.'</p>

<p>'She's right there,' observed a man in the
crowd. 'Them tigers—Runham and Drownlands—would
fight about a straw.'</p>

<p>'Are you going to hand me over that flail?'
asked the dark purchaser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Zita remained for a moment undecided. She
had in verity made an unprecedented price with
the first, and she was half inclined to surrender
the second gratis, but to give and receive nothing
was against the moral code of Cheap Jacks from
the beginning of Cheap Jacking. Whilst she
hesitated, holding the flail in suspense, and with
a finger on her lips, the fair man yelled out—</p>

<p>'Don't let the blackguard have it. I'll have
it to spoil the pair for him, and for no other
reason.'</p>

<p>'I will have it, you scoundrel!' howled the
dark man. 'I have as much gold as ever you
have. I don't care what I spend. Here, girl!
a crown to begin with.'</p>

<p>'Seven and six,' shouted Runham.</p>

<p>'Ten shillings,' cried Drownlands.</p>

<p>'Fifteen shillings!' exclaimed the fair man.
Then, seeing that his rival was about to bid, he
yelled, 'A guinea!' at the same moment that
the other called, 'A pound!'</p>

<p>'It is yours,' said the girl to the man
Runham, and she handed him the flail. She
saw that the passions of the two men were
roused, and she deemed it desirable to close
the scene, lest a fight should ensue, in which,
possibly, she might lose the money that had
been offered.</p>

<p>Runham, flourishing his flail over his head,
and throwing out the flapper in the direction
of Drownlands, said, 'There, now! Who can

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

say but what I'm the best off of the two?
Mine cost me a guinea, and his beggarly flail
not above twelve and six. I am the better man
of the two by eight and six.'</p>

<p>He felt in his pockets and drew forth a
guinea.</p>

<p>'There, you Cheap Jack girl—here's your
money all in gold. I'm the better man of the
two by eight and six. I've beat Drownlands
like a gentleman.'</p>

<p>Some one looking on in the crowd said, 'A
pair o' flails and a pair o' fools at the end o'
them, as don't know what is the vally o' their
money. Never since the creation of the world
was flails sold at that price, and never will be
again.'</p>

<p>'And never would have been, or never could
have been, anywhere but among fen-tigers,'
said another.</p>

<p>'I'll tell'y what,' observed the first; 'this ain't
the end o' the story.'</p>

<p>'No—I guess not. It's the beginnin' rather
of a mighty queer tale.'</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TWO CROWNS</p>

<p class="p1">A STRANGELY interesting city is Ely.Unique in its way is the metropolis of
the Fens; wonderful exceeding it must have
been in the olden times when the fen-land was
one great inland sea, studded at wide intervals
with islets as satellites about the great central
isle of Ely. It was a scene that impressed the
imagination of our forefathers. Stately is the
situation of Durham, that occupies a tongue of
land between ravines. It has its own unique
and royal splendour. But hardly if at all
inferior, though very different, is the situation
of Ely. The fens extend on all sides to the
horizon, flat as the sea, and below the sea level.
If the dykes were broken through, or the steam
pumps and windmills ceased to work, all would
again, in a twelvemonth, revert to its primitive
condition of a vast inland sea, out of which
would rise the marl island of Ely, covered with
buildings amidst tufted trees, reflecting themselves

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

in the still water as in a glass. Above
the roofs, above the tree-tops, soars that glorious
cathedral, one of the very noblest, certainly one
of the most beautiful, in England—nay, let it
be spoken boldly—in the whole Christian world.
It stands as a beacon seen from all parts of the
Fens, and it is the pride of the Fens.</p>

<p>Ely owes its origin to a woman—St. Etheldreda—flying
from a rude, dissolute, and drunken
court. She was the wife first of Tombert, a
Saxon prince in East Anglia, then of Egfrid of
Northumbria. Sick of the coarse revelry, the
rude manners of a Saxon court, Etheldreda fled
and hid herself in the isle of Ely, where she
would be away from men and alone with God
and wild, beautiful nature.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think of the morality of
a wife deserting her post at the side of her
husband, of a queen abandoning her position in
a kingdom, we cannot, perhaps, be surprised at
it. A tender, gentle-spirited woman after a
while sickened of the brutality of the ways of
a Saxon court, its drunkenness and savagery,
and fled that she might find in solitude that
rest for her weary soul and overstrained nerves
she could not find in the Northumbrian palace.
This was in the year 673. Then this islet was
unoccupied. It has been supposed that it takes
its name from the eels that abounded round it;
we are, perhaps, more correct in surmising that
it was originally called the Elf-isle, the islet

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

inhabited by the mythic spiritual beings who
danced in the moonlight and sported over the
waters of the meres.</p>

<p>This lovely island, covered with woods, surrounded
by a fringe of water-lilies, gold and
silver, floating far out as a lace about it, became
the seat of a great monastery. Monks succeeded
the elves.</p>

<p>King Canute, the Dane, was seized with admiration
for Ely, loved to visit it in his barge,
or come to it over the ice. It is said that one
Candlemas Day, when, as was his wont, King
Canute came towards Ely, he found the meres
overflowed and frozen. A 'ceorl' named Brithmer
led the way for Canute's sledge over the
ice, proving the thickness of the ice by his
own weight. For this service his lands were
enfranchised.</p>

<p>On another occasion the king passed the isle
in his barge, and over the still and glassy water
came the strains of the singing in the minster.
Whereupon the king composed a song, of which
only the first stanza has been preserved, that
may be modernised thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent6">'Merry sang the monks of Ely</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">As King Knut came rowing by.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Oarsmen, row the land more near</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">That I may hear their song more clear.'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ely, although it be a city, is yet but a village.
The houses are few, seven thousand inhabitants
is the population, it has two or three parish

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

churches, and the cathedral, the longest in
Christendom. The houses are of brick or of
plaster; and a curious custom exists in Ely of
encrusting the plaster with broken glass, so
that a house-front sparkles in the sun as though
frosted. All the roofs are tiled. The cathedral
is constructed of stone quarried in Northamptonshire,
and brought in barges to the isle.</p>

<p>Ely possesses no manufactures, has almost no
neighbourhood, stands solitary and self-contained.
On some sides it rises rapidly from
the fen, on others it slopes easily down. A
singular effect is produced when the white mists
hang over the fen-land for miles and miles, and
the sun glitters on the island city. Then it is
as an enchanted isle of eternal spring, lost in a
wilderness of level snow. Or again, on a night
when the auroral lights flicker over the heavens,
here red, there silvery, and against the glowing
skies towers up this isle crowned with its mighty
cathedral, then, verily, it is as though it were a
scene in some fairy tale, some magic creation of
Eastern fantasy.</p>

<p>A girl was sauntering through the wide,
grass-grown streets of Ely. During the fair
the streets were full of people—nay, full is not
the word—were occupied by people more or
less scattered about them. It would take a
vast throng, such as the fens of Cambridgeshire
cannot supply, to <em>fill</em> these wide spaces.</p>

<p>The girl was tall and handsome, rather masculine,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

with a cheerful face. She had very fair
hair, a bright complexion, and eyes of a dazzling
blue—a blue as of the sea when rippling and
sparkling in the midsummer sun. She was
plainly dressed in serge of dark navy blue,
with white kerchief about her neck, a chip hat-bonnet
and blue ribbons in it. Her skirts were
somewhat short, they exposed neat ankles in
stockings white as snow, and strong shoes. A
fen-girl must wear strong shoes, she cannot have
gloves on her feet.</p>

<p>'Jimminy!' said the girl, as she turned her
pocket inside out. 'Not one penny! Poor
Kainie is the only girl at the fair without a
sweetheart, the only child without a fairing.
No one to treat me! Nothing to be got for
nothing. Jimminy! I don't care.' Then she
began to sing:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">'Last night the dogs did bark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">I went to the gate to see.</div>

    <div class="verse indent10">And it's Oh dear! what will become of me?</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Oh dear, what shall I do?</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then suddenly she confronted the fair-haired
farmer Runham, coming out of a tavern, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the flail over his shoulder. A little disconcerted
at encountering him, she paused in her song,
but soon recovered herself, and began again at
the interrupted verse:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">'My father's a hedger and ditcher,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">My mother'—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>'Kainie! Are you beside yourself, singing
like a ballad-monger in the open street?'</p>

<p>The man's face was red, whether with drink,
or that the sight of the girl had brought the
colour into his face, Kainie could not say. His
breath smelt of spirits, and she turned her head
away.</p>

<p>'It's all nonsense,' she said. 'My mother is
dead—is dead—and I am alone. I don't know,
I don't see why I should not sing; I want a
fairing, and have no money. I'll go along
singing, "My father's a hedger and ditcher,"
and then some charitable folk will throw me
coppers, and I shall get a little money and buy
myself a fairing.'</p>

<p>'For heaven's sake, do nothing of the kind.
Here—rather than that—here is a crown.
Take that. What would the Commissioners
say if they were told that you went a ballad-singing
in the streets of Ely at Tawdry Fair?
They would turn you out of your mill. I am
sure they would. Here, Kainie, conduct yourself
respectably, and take a crown.'</p>

<p>He pressed the large silver coin into her
hand, and hurried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>'That's brave!' exclaimed the girl, snapping
her fingers. 'Now I can buy my fairing.
Now, all I want is a lover.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">"Nobody coming to marry me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Nobody coming to woo!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jimminy! I must not do that! I've taken a
crown to be mum. Now I'm a young person
of respectability—I've money in my pocket.
Now I must look about me and see what to
buy. I'll go to the Cheap Jack. How do you
do, uncle?'</p>

<p>She addressed the dark-haired man Drownlands,
who had just turned the corner, with his
flail over his shoulder. He scowled at the girl,
and would have passed her without a word, but
to this she would not consent.</p>

<p>'See! see!' said she, holding up the crown
she had received. 'I was just going along
sighing and weeping because I had no money,
not a farthing in my pocket, not a lover at my
side to buy me anything. Then came some
one and gave me this—look, Uncle Drownlands!
Five shillings!'</p>

<p>'So—going in bad ways?'</p>

<p>'What is the harm? I was ballad-singing.
Then he came and gave me a crown.'</p>

<p>'You ballad-singing!'</p>

<p>'Yes; how else can I get money? I'm a poor
girl, owned by nobody, for whom nobody cares.'</p>

<p>'You will bring disgrace—deeper disgrace on
the family—on the name.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>'Not I; I'm honest. If I am given five
shillings, may I not receive it? Master Runham
gave me the money to make me shut my
mouth. I was singing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">"My father's a hedger and ditcher,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">My mother"'—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>'For heaven's sake, silence!' said Drownlands
angrily. 'If you will hold your tongue, I will
give you a couple of shillings.'</p>

<p>'A couple of shillings! And I'm your own
niece, and have your name.'</p>

<p>'More shame to you—to your mother!' exclaimed
the farmer bitterly.</p>

<p>The girl suddenly dropped her head, and her
brow became crimson.</p>

<p>'Not a word about my dear mother—not a
stone thrown at her,' she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>'Well, no ballad-singing. Take heed to yourself.
You are wild and careless.'</p>

<p>'Much you think of me! much you care for
me!'</p>

<p>'Begone! You are a disgrace to me—your
existence is a disgrace. Take a crown and
spend it properly. You shall have nothing
more from me. As Runham gave you five
shillings, it shall not be said that I gave you
less.'</p>

<p>He handed her the coin, and with a scowl
passed on.</p>

<p>Kainie remained for a moment musing, with
lowered eyes. Then she raised her head, shook

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>

it, as though to shake off the sadness, the
humiliation that had come on her with the
words of Drownlands, and hummed—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">'Nobody coming to marry me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Nobody coming to woo.'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>'What! Kainie!'</p>

<p>The words were those of a young man,
heavy-browed, pale, somewhat gaunt, with long
arms.</p>

<p>'Oh, Pip!—Pip!—Pip!'</p>

<p>'What is the matter, Kainie?'</p>

<p>'Pip, I'm the only girl here without her
young man. It is terrible—terrible; and see,
Pip, I've got two crowns to spend, and I don't
know what to spend them on. There is too
much money here for sweetie stuff; and as for
smart ribbons and bonnets and such like, it is
only just about once in the year I can get away
from the mill and come into town and show
myself. It does seem a waste to spend a couple
of crowns on dress, when no one can see me
rigged out in it. What shall I do, Pip?—you
wise, you sensible, you dear Pip.'</p>

<p>The young man, Ephraim Beamish, considered;
then he said—</p>

<p>'Kainie, I don't like your being alone in Red
Wings. Times are queer. Times will be worse.
There is trouble before us in the Fens. Things
cannot go on as they are—the labouring men
ground down under the heels of the farmers,
who are thriving and waxing fat. I don't like

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>

you to be alone in the windmill; you should
have some protector. Now, look here. I've
been to that Cheap Jack van, and there's a big
dog there the Cheap Jackies want to sell, but
there has been no bid. Take my advice, offer
the two crowns for that great dog, and take him
home with you. Then I shall be easy; and
now I am not that. You are too lonely—and a
good-looking girl like you'—</p>

<p>'Pip, I'll have the dog.' She tossed the coins
into the air. 'Here, crownies, you go for a bow-wow.'</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ON THE DROVE</p>

<p class="p1">THERE is not in all England—there is
hardly in the world—any tract of country
more depressing to the spirits, more void of
elements of loveliness, than the Cambridgeshire
Fens as they now are.</p>

<p>In former days, when they were under water—a
haunt of wildfowl, a wilderness of lagoons,
a paradise of wild-flowers—when they teemed
with fish and swarmed with insect life of every
kind—when the <i>eys</i> or islets, Stuntney, Shipey,
Southconey, Welney, were the sole objects that
broke the horizon, rising out of the marshes,
rich with forest-trees—then the Fens were full of
charm, because given over to Nature. But the
industry of man has changed the character and
aspect of the Fens. The meres have been
pumped dry, the bogland has been drained.
Where the fowler used to boat after wild duck,
now turnips are hoed; where the net was drawn
by the fisherman, there wave cornfields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In former times, for five-and-twenty miles
north of Ely, one rippling lake extended, and
men went by boat over it to the sand-dune that
divided it from the sea at King's Lynn. To the
west a mighty mere stretched from Ely to
Peterborough. To the east lay a tangle of lake
and channel, of marsh and islet.</p>

<p>Until about a hundred years ago, men lived in
houses erected on platforms sustained upon piles
above the level of the water. Walls and roofs
of these habitations were thatched and wattled
with reeds. From the door a ladder conducted
to a boat. In these houses there were hearths,
but no chimneys. The smoke escaped as best
it might through the thatch, or under the gables.
During the winter the fen-men picked up a
livelihood fishing and fowling. In summer they
cultivated such patches of peat soil as appeared
above the surface of the water. There were no
roads; men went from place to place by water,
in boats or on skates.</p>

<p>In the reign of James I. Ben Jonson wrote
his play 'The Devil is an Ass.' Into this
play he introduced a speculator—a starter of
bogus companies, by name Meercraft, and one
of this man's schemes was the draining of the
Fens.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent6">The thing is for recovery of drown'd land,</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">I have computed all, and made my survey</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Unto an acre; I'll begin at the pan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Not at the skirts, as some have done, and lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">All that they wrought, their timberwork, their trench,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Their banks, all borne away, or else filled up</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">'Twill yield a pound an acre;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">We must let cheap ever at first.'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jonson introduced this Meercraft as a caution
to the people of his day against being induced
to sink money in such ventures, which he regarded
as impossible of realisation. Nevertheless,
what Jonson disbelieved in has been
accomplished. The work begun in 1630, was
interrupted by the Civil Wars, resumed afterwards,
was carried on at considerable outlay and
with great perseverance, till at the beginning of
the present century the complete recovery of
the Fens was an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Great was the cost of the undertaking, and
those who had invested in it wearied of the
calls on their purses; land, or rather water,
owners were discouraged, and were ready to
part with rights and possessions that hardly
fetched a shilling an acre, and which instead of
being drained itself seemed to be draining their
pockets. Long-headed fen-men saw their advantage,
and bought eagerly where the owners

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

sold eagerly. The new canals carried off the
water, the machines set in operation discharged
the drainage into the main conduits, and soil
that for centuries had been worthless became
auriferous. No more magnificent corn-growing
land was to be found in England. None in
Europe might compare with it, save the delta of
the Danube and the richest alluvial tracts in
South Russia. The fen-men made their fortunes
before they had learned what to do with the
fortunes they made. Money came faster than
they found means to spend it.</p>

<p>To this day many of the wealthiest owners
are sons or grandsons of half-wild fen-slodgers.
There are no villages in the Fens apart from
such as are clustered on widely dispersed islets.
There are no old picturesque farmhouses and
cottages. Everything is new and ugly. There
are no hedges, no walls, for there is no stone in
the country. There are no trees, save a few
willows and an occasional ash, from whose roots
the soil has shrunk. The surface of the land
is sinking. As the fen is drained, the spongy
soil contracts, and sinks at the rate of two
inches in the year. Consequently houses built
on piles are left after fifty years some eight feet
above the surface, and steps have to be added
to enable the inmates to descend from their
doors.</p>

<p>The rivers slide along on a level with the top
storeys of the houses, and the only objects to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>

break the horizon are the windmills that drive
the water up from the dykes into the canals.</p>

<p>There are no roads, as there is no material of
which roads can be made. In place of roads
there are 'droves.' A drove is a broad course,
straight as an arrow, by means of which communication
is had between one farm and
another, and people pass from one village to
another.</p>

<p>These droves have ditches, one on each side,
dense in summer with bulrushes. No attempt
is made to consolidate the soil in these droves
other than by harrowing and rolling them in
summer. In winter they are bogs, in summer
they are dust—dust black, impalpable. Wheeled
conveyances can hardly get along the droves in
winter, or wet weather, as the wheels sink to the
axles.</p>

<p>The canal banks, however, are solid, compacted
of stiff clay, and as they are broad, so as
to resist the pressure of the water they contain
between them, their tops make very tolerable
paths, and roads for those on horseback. But
no wheeled vehicle is suffered to use the bank
tops, and to prevent these banks from being
converted into carriage roads, barriers are placed
across them at intervals, which horses with
riders easily leap.</p>

<p>At one of the Cambridge Assizes a poor man,
a witness in court, when asked his profession,
answered,—'My lord, I am a banker.' The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>

judge, turning very red, said, 'No joking here,
sir.' 'But I <em>am</em> a banker and nothing else,'
protested the witness. He was, in fact, one of
the gang of men maintained for the reparation
of the canal banks.</p>

<p>The reader must be given some idea of the
manner in which this vast level region is drained.
It is cut up into large squares, and each square
is a field that is surrounded by dykes. These
dykes are in communication with one another,
and all lead to a <i>drain</i> or <i>load</i>, that is to say, to
a channel of water of a secondary size, that
lies at the level of a few feet above the dykes.
To convey the water from the ditches into
the drains, windmills are erected, that work
machinery which throws the water out of the
ditches up hill into the loads. These loads or
drains run to the canal at intervals of two miles;
and when the drain reaches the canal bank,
then a pump of great power forces the water of
the load to a still higher level, into the main
artery through which it flows to the sea. On
the canals are lighters, and these, rather than
waggons, serve for the conveyance of farm
produce to the markets. Water is the natural
highway in the fen-land.</p>

<p>The short October day had closed in. The
fen lay black, streaked with steely bands—the
dykes that reflected the grey sky.</p>

<p>On the right hand was a bank rising some
fourteen feet above the roadway; it was the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>

embankment of the river or canal that goes by
the name of the Lark. Above it, some wan
stars were flickering. On the left hand the fen
stretched away into infinity, the horizon was
lost in fog.</p>

<p>The Cheap Jack's horse was crawling, reeling
along the drove under the embankment, the van
plunging into quagmires, lurching into ruts.
The horse strained every muscle and drew it
forward a few yards, then sighed, hung his
head, and remained immovable. Once again
he nerved himself to the effort, and as the van
started, its contents tinkled and rattled. The
brute might as well have been drawing it across
a ploughed field. Again he heaved a heavy
sigh, and then finally abandoned the effort.</p>

<p>The Cheap Jack had got out of the conveyance.
He was unwell, too unwell to walk, but he could
not think of adding his weight to that the poor
horse was compelled to drag over what was not
the apology for, but the mockery of a road.</p>

<p>'I say, Zit,' muttered he hoarsely, 'I wish
now as we'd a' stayed overnight in Ely.'</p>

<p>'I wish we had, father. And we could have
afforded it; we've made fine profits in Ely—tremenjous.'</p>

<p>The man did not respond. He trudged and
stumbled on.</p>

<p>The drove was as intolerable to walk on as
to drive along.</p>

<p>'Well, I never came along roads like these

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>

afore,' said the girl, 'and I hopes we may soon be
out of the Fens, and never get into them again.'</p>

<p>'I don't know as we shall ever get out,' said
the man, reeling as one drunk. 'It seems as
if we was sinking—sinking—and the black mud
would close over us.'</p>

<p>'Come along, Jewel!' said Zita to the old
horse. 'I'd put the lash of the whip across you,
but I haven't the heart to do it.'</p>

<p>'This is going like snails,' groaned the man.</p>

<p>'It's going worse than snails,' retorted his
daughter. 'Snails carry their houses safely
along with them, but I doubt if we shall convey
our van out of this here region o' stick-in-the-mud,
without all its in'ards being knocked to bits.
We'll have to yarn tremenjous, father, to cover
the dints in the tin and the cracks in the crocks.'</p>

<p>The man halted.</p>

<p>'I don't think I can get no forrarder,' said he;
'I'm all of a quake and a chill.'</p>

<p>'Well, father, let us put up here. It's no
odds to us where we stay.'</p>

<p>'But it is to the hoss. What's Jewel to eat?
There's nought but mud and rushes. If we do
take him out of the shafts, he'll tumble into one
of the ditches.'</p>

<p>'I wonder what is the distance to Littleport?'
asked the girl. 'But, bless me! on these roads
it's no calculating distances. There was a man
rode by us on the bank above. He had lanterns
to his stirrups. I wish I'd gone up the side and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

just asked him how far ahead it was to Littleport.
Now he's got a long way ahead, and it's no use
to run after him.'</p>

<p>'We must go on. I doubt but we shall sink
in the mire if we stay.'</p>

<p>The man sighed and staggered forward.
Then the horse also sighed and endeavoured to
move the van, but failed. It was fast.</p>

<p>'What is to be done now? There's Jewel
can't stir the caravan. Did you notice, father,
how that man's horse jumped as he rode by?
There is a sort of a rail across, or we would
have tried to get the conveyance up on the
bank. When the horse jumped, up went the
lanterns also. I suppose there is some farm
near here where they'll let us put up Jewel for
the night. We needn't trouble then, as we have
our own house on wheels. But Jewel must
have his food and a stall.'</p>

<p>At that moment a second rider appeared on
the embankment, trotting in the same direction
as had the first. He had a single lantern
attached to one stirrup, whereas the first who
had passed, and been noticed by Zita, had two.
The girl ran up the slope of the bank, calling.</p>

<p>The rider drew rein. 'What do you want?'
he inquired.</p>

<p>'Oh, will you tell me where we can put our
horse for the night and have a little hay?'</p>

<p>'Who are you?'</p>

<p>Zita knew by the tone of the voice that the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>

man had been drinking, and that, though not
inebriated, he had taken too much liquor—</p>

<p>'We are the Cheap Jack and his daughter.
We cannot get along the way, it is so bad—and
the wheels are stuck in the mud. We want
to go to Littleport, and father'—</p>

<p>'You are a set of darned rascals!' interrupted
the rider. 'I'll have nothing more to do with
you; and you, I suppose, are the gal as cheated
me—the worst of the lot you are.' He had a
flail in his hand, and he flourished it over his
head. 'You get along, you Cheap Jackies, or
I'll bring the flail down about your heads and
shoulders and loins, and make you fish out that
there guinea I paid—and more fool I.' Driving
his heels into the flanks of his horse, and slashing
its neck with the loop of his bridle, he galloped
along the top of the embankment.</p>

<p>Zita descended.</p>

<p>The van was stationary. The horse, Jewel,
stood with drooping head and a pout on the
nether lip, with legs stiff in the deep mire,
resolute not to budge another inch. Zita took
the van lantern and went to his head. Jewel
had thrown an expression into his face that
proclaimed his resolution not to make another
effort, whether urged on by whip, or cajoled by
caresses. The girl, still carrying the lantern,
came to her father. He was seated against the
embankment, with his hands in his pockets and
his head fallen forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>'Father, how are you?'</p>

<p>'Bad—bad—tremenjous.'</p>

<p>'Father, let us walk on and seek a house.
Jewel will not stir; he has turned up his nose
and set back his ears, and I know what that
means. I don't think any one will come this
way and rob the van. Let us go on together.
You lean on me, and we will find a farm.'</p>

<p>'I can't rise, Zit.'</p>

<p>'Let me help you up.'</p>

<p>'I couldn't take another step, Zit.'</p>

<p>'Make an effort, father.'</p>

<p>'I'm past that, Zit. I'm dying. It's o' no
use urging of me. I sticks here as does Jewel.
I can't move. I'm too bad for that. O Lord!
that I should die in this here fen-land!'</p>

<p>'Let me get you some brandy.'</p>

<p>'It ain't of no use at all, Zit. I'm just about
done for. 'Tis so with goods at times; when
they gets battered and bulged and broken and
all to pieces, they must be chucked aside. I'm
no good no more as a Cheap Jack. I'm battered
and bulged and broken and all to pieces, so I'm
going to be chucked aside.'</p>

<p>Zita considered for a moment. Then she set
down the lantern at her father's side, ran up
the embankment, ran along it in the direction
which had been taken by the riders, one after
the other, crying as loud as she possibly could,
'Help! help! Father is dying. Help! help!
help!'</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE FLAILS AGAIN</p>

<p class="p1">HEZEKIAH, or, as he was usually called
for short, Ki, Drownlands was riding
homewards from the Ely Fair along the embankment
of the river Lark. He bore over his
shoulder the flail that had cost him twelve
shillings and sixpence, and in his heart glowed
a consuming rage that his adversary and neighbour—perhaps
adversary because neighbour—Jeremiah
or Jake Runham had paid a guinea for
the companion flail, and had outbidden him.</p>

<p>It was not that Ki Drownlands particularly
required a flail, or a companion flail to that he
had secured, but he was intolerant of opposition,
and it was his ambition to be first in his fen; he
would show his supremacy by outbidding the
only man approaching him in wealth and in influence,
and that before a crowd made up in
part of people who knew him and his rival. It
was gall to his liver to think that he had been
surpassed in his offer, that an advantage over

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>

him had been snatched, and that Jake Runham
had been able to carry off from under his nose
something—it mattered not what—that he, Ki
Drownlands, had coveted, and had let people
see that he had coveted.</p>

<p>The rivalry of these two landowners was
known throughout the Ely Fens, and in every
tavern the talk was certain to turn on the bidding
for the flails, and folk would say, 'Jake is a
better man than Ki by eight shillings and
sixpence.'</p>

<p>Drownlands had been drinking, and this fact
served to sharpen and inflame his resentment,
but he was able to ride upright and steadily,
and sit his horse upright and steadily as the
beast leaped the barriers on the bank. He
carried, as already mentioned, lanterns below
both feet attached to the stirrups. They
illumined the way, they flashed upon obstructions,
they sent a gleam over the water of the
canal. In the dark—and the night was at times
pitch-dark, when clouds cut off the light of the
stars—then it was not safe to ride on the embankment
without a light. The horse might
fail to see the barriers, and precipitate itself
against them. It might slip down the bank
and fall with its rider, on one side into the river,
on the other into the drove. On the one side
the horseman might be drowned, on the other
break his neck. But, supposing the horse had
its wits about it and its eyes open, the rider

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>

might have neither, and be unprepared for the
leap, or the slip in the greasy marl.</p>

<p>If, conscious of the risk when on the embankment,
the horseman took the drove; then also
he was not safe, for there it was doubly dark,
shadowed on one side by the elevation of the
embankment, whilst on the other side lay the
dyke, the water brimming, and disguised by
sedge and rushes. Into this a horse might
plunge, and, once in, could not be extricated
without infinite labour by several hands. For
the bottom of the ditches is soft bog, and the
sides are spongy peat. Not a particle of firm
substance can be found on which a horse may
plant its feet, and obtain the purchase necessary
for lifting itself out of the water and mire.
Consequently, when farmers returned late from
market and fair in the long dark winter nights,
they provided themselves with lanterns.</p>

<p>Prickwillow was the name of the farm of
Master Ki Drownlands. The grandfather of Ki
had possessed a reed-walled cottage on piles,
and a few acres of soil that showed above the
water in March, was submerged again for a
while in July, and then reappeared as the rainy
season ceased. Here he was wont to prick in
willow twigs that rapidly grew into osier beds.
On a platform above the rippling water the
grandfather had mended his nets and cleaned
his fowling-piece, and the grandmother had
woven baskets. Now all was dry, and a house

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>

stood where had been the lacustrine habitation,
and the plough turned up the thousand odds
and ends that successive generations had cast
out of the cottage into the water, never expecting
that they would be seen again.</p>

<p>The flood had retreated, dry land had
appeared, and the ark had rested on what had
formerly been the least submerged portion of the
tract over which the ancestral slodger, Drownlands,
had exercised more or less questionable
rights; rights, however, which, though questionable,
had never been questioned. With a little
money collected by industry, and more borrowed
from the Ely bank, the <i>p&egrave;re</i> Drownlands had extended
his domain, and had rendered his claim
absolute and his rights unassailable.</p>

<p>And now Ki Drownlands was riding home
in a fume of wounded pride, and with a brain
somewhat turned by brandy. He sharply drew
rein; he thought he heard a cry. The cry was
repeated as he halted to listen. From whence
it came he could not judge, saving only that it
proceeded from the rear. Over the fen, as
upon water, sound travels great distances; over
the fen, as over water, meeting with no obstructions,
the waves of sound pass, and it is not
easy to judge distances. Drownlands turned
his horse about and faced in the direction of
Ely, the direction whence the call came, as far
as he could judge.</p>

<p>He saw a light approaching. Was it carried,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>

or hung to a stirrup? He could not tell.
Was it the lantern-bearer who summoned him?
If so, for what object? The cry was repeated.</p>

<p>Surely the voice was that of a female. If the
appeal were not to him, to whom could it be
addressed?</p>

<p>To the best of his knowledge, there was no
one else out so late on the embankment. He
recalled passing no one.</p>

<p>It was true that he had ridden by the van, but
he had not seen it. The van was in the drove
below, and he had been twelve or fourteen feet
above the roadway. Moreover, the lanterns at
his feet threw a halo about him, and though
they illumined every object that came within
their radius, yet they made all doubly obscure
and everything indistinguishable that was outside
that radius.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Drownlands had been occupied
with his own thoughts, and had not been in an
observant mood.</p>

<p>Zita had not addressed him as he rode by,
and he had passed without any notion that there
were travellers toiling along in the same direction
at a lower level. He had not expected to
see a conveyance there, and had looked for none.</p>

<p>The light that he noticed on the bank was
approaching. It was held at no great distance
from the ground. It might equally be carried
in the hand of one on foot, or be swung from
the stirrups of a rider. It was, however, improbable

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

that a horseman would be contented with
a single light.</p>

<p>Drownlands did not ride forward to meet the
advancing light. He remained stationary, with
his right hand holding the flail, so that the end
of the staff rested on his thigh, much as a field-marshal
is represented in pictures holding his
<i>bâton</i>.</p>

<p>In the Fens the horses are unshod, and on a
way that is without stones there will be little
sound of a horse when trotting; but as the
moving light neared, Drownlands was aware
from the vibration of the embankment that a
horse was approaching.</p>

<p>A minute later, and he saw before him Jake
Runham, mounted.</p>

<p>The recognition was mutual.</p>

<p>'Out of my way!' shouted Runham. 'Out of
my way, you dog, or I will ride you down!'</p>

<p>'I will not get out of your way. Why did
you call?'</p>

<p>'I call? I call you? That's a likely tale.
What should I want with a twopenny-ha'penny
chap such as you?'</p>

<p>'Twopenny-ha'penny? Do you mean me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I do.'</p>

<p>'You are drunk. Some one called.'</p>

<p>'Not I. But I call now, and loud enough.
Stand out of my way; get down the side of the
bank; and go to the devil.'</p>

<p>'I will not make way for you,' said Drownlands.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

Then between his teeth, 'It is well we
have met.'</p>

<p>'Ay, it is well.'</p>

<p>'Now we can settle old scores. Now'—he
looked up, and waved his flail towards heaven,
which was clad with clouds—'now that no eyes
look down from above, and we are quite sure
there are no eyes watching us from below'—</p>

<p>Then Runham, with a yell, dug his spurs into
the flanks of his steed, and made him bound
forward. His intention was, with the impetus,
to drive his adversary and horse down the bank.
As it was, his horse struck that of Drownlands,
which, being a heavy beast, swerved but slightly.</p>

<p>'Keep off, you drunken fool!' shouted Ki.</p>

<p>'Am I to keep off you? I? Not I. I will
have the bank to myself. Let me pass, or I
will ride over you and tread your brains out.'</p>

<p>'You will have the matter of the past fought
out between us?'</p>

<p>'Ay! Ay!'</p>

<p>Jake backed his horse, snorting and plunging
under the curb.</p>

<p>Then, when he had retired some twenty yards,
he uttered a halloo, whirled his flail above his
head, drove his heels into the sides of his steed,
and came on at a gallop.</p>

<p>Drownlands raised and brandished his flail,
and brought it down with a sweep before him.
This alarmed his own horse, which reared and
started, but more so that of his rival, which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

suddenly leaped on one side, and nearly unseated
Jake Runham. However, Jake gripped
the pommel, and with an oath urged his horse
into the path again.</p>

<p>Drownlands had forgotten about the call
that had induced him to turn his horse. His
attention was solely occupied with the man
before him.</p>

<p>The situation was one in which two resolute
men, each determined not to yield to the other,
each inflamed with anger against the other,
must fight their controversy out to the end.
The way on the bank top would not admit of
two abreast, consequently not of one passing
the other without mutual concession. On the
one side was the drove fourteen feet below, on
the other the canal. He who had to give way
must roll down the embankment into the drove
or plunge into the water.</p>

<p>Each man was armed, and each with a like
weapon.</p>

<p>It would seem as though the horses understood
the feelings that actuated their riders, and shared
them. They snorted defiance, they tossed their
manes, they reared and pawed the air.</p>

<p>Again Runham spurred his steed, and the
beasts clashed together, and as they did so, so
also did the flails.</p>

<p>The two men were at close quarters, too
close for the flappers of the flails to take full
effect. They heaved their weapons and struck

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

furiously at each other, bruising flesh, but
breaking no bones. The strokes of the whistling
flappers fell on the saddle back, on the sides
of the horses, rather than on the heads and
shoulders of the men. The lanterns jerked
and danced, as the horses pawed and plunged,
and bit at each other.</p>

<p>The men swore, and strove by main weight to
force each other from the bank,—Runham to
drive his antagonist into the river, Drownlands
by side blows of the flail to force the opposed
horse to go down the bank into the drove.</p>

<p>The struggle lasted for some minutes. To
any one standing by it would have seemed a
confusion of dancing lights and reflections—a
confusion also of oaths, blows, and clash of
steel bits, and thud of ashen staves.</p>

<p>Then, by mutual consent, but unexpressed, the
two men drew back equally exhausted. They
drew back with no thought of yielding, but with
intent to recover wind and strength to renew
the contest. Both antagonists remained planted
opposite each other, panting, quivering with
excitement, their beasts steaming in the cold
October night air.</p>

<p>'You dared to call me by an ugly name before
folk!' shouted Drownlands.</p>

<p>'Dared?—I will do it again.'</p>

<p>'You shall not be given the chance.'</p>

<p>'I carried away the flail over your head because
you hadn't more shillings in your pocket.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>'The flail?' echoed Drownlands. 'This is
not a matter now of a flail. This is not a
matter now of a way along the bank. It's a
matter of nineteen years' endurance. For
nineteen years I have borne the grossest of
wrongs. I'll bear the burden no longer. The
wrong shall not go another hour unavenged.'</p>

<p>'You've borne it so long the back is accustomed
to the burden,' taunted Jake.</p>

<p>'For nineteen years I have endured it. But
to-night we are face to face, and alone.' Again
he waved his flail to heaven. 'No eye looks
down upon us. I and you are equally matched
as far as weapons go. All is fair between us,
but if there be justice on high, it will weight my
arm to beat you down; and here,' said he,
touching his breast with the end of the flail,—'here
is no spark of pity, just as there is now
no spark aloft. If I beat you, I beat you till
the blood runs, beat you till the bones are
pounded, beat you till the marrow oozes out,
beat you—as we beat hemp.'</p>

<p>Then, unable longer to control his fury, the
dark man urged his horse forward with his
spurs, and as he did so, the lanterns clashed
against the flanks of the brute, and burnt them
as the spurs had stung them. With a snort of
anger and pain, the beast leaped into the air,
flung himself forward, and hurled his whole
weight against the horse of Runham. The
latter had altered his tactics, and had drawn up

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>

to receive the charge instead of delivering it as
before. At the same moment Ki swung his
flail and brought it down. But he had overshot
his mark, and with the violence of the blow
he was carried across the neck of Runham's
horse. Jake saw his advantage at once, caught
him by the tiger-skin, and, grappling that,
endeavoured to drag his opponent out of the
saddle. But Ki reared himself up, and tried to
wrench the skin away. His bodily strength
was the greatest. The horses leaped, kicked,
reeled, and the two men on them held fast, the
tiger-skin between them. Then Runham twisted
his flail in the skin and continued to turn it.
In vain now did Ki endeavour to wrench it
away. The skin was fast about his throat, and
as it was drawn tighter and even tighter, it
threatened strangulation. Jake backed his
horse, and as he backed, he drew his opponent
after him. The blood thumped in the ears of
Drownlands. The veins in his temples swelled
to bursting.</p>

<p>The plunging of the horses caused the pressure
to be relaxed for one moment, but it was
tightened the next, and became intolerable.
Ki's tongue and eyes started, his lips were
puffed, foam formed on them. He could not
cry, he could not speak, he snuffled and gasped.
With his heels he thrust his horse forward, to
save himself from being drawn from his saddle
to hang to the flail of Runham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>In another moment Drownlands would have
been unhorsed and at his adversary's mercy.
But at this supreme instant he clutched his
own flail, and, holding it with both hands over
his bent head, drove the end of it into the ear of
Runham's horse. The more he was drawn
forward, the greater the leverage on the end of
his flail, and the more exquisite the agony of
the horse. The brute, driven mad with pain,
gathered itself up into a convulsive, spasmodic
shake and leap, and with the jerk, the tiger-skin
was plucked out of the hand of Jake Runham.</p>

<p>Drownlands reared himself in his stirrups.
He was blinded with blood in his eyes, but he
whirled the flail round his head, and beat
savagely in all directions. It whistled as it
swung, it screamed as it descended. Then a
thud, a cry, and indistinctly, through the roar of
his pulses in his ears, he heard a crash down the
bank, and indistinctly through his suffused eyes
he saw a black mass stagger into the river.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, quivering in every nerve,
tingling in every vein, as the blood recovered
its wonted circulation, Drownlands held his
horse motionless, and, gathering his senses,
looked before him.</p>

<p>There was hardly a flake of steely light in the
sky. Clouds had spread over the firmament.
What little light there was, lay as a strip on
the horizon, like the glaze of white in a dead
man's eye. The inky water reflected none of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>

it. For a moment, on the surface, the lantern
attached to Runham's stirrup floated and
danced, whilst the flame burnt and charred
the horn side, then it was drawn under and
extinguished.</p>

<p>Drownlands leaned forward and stretched
his flail to the water; then drew the flapper
across the surface where his enemy had sunk,
as one who scratches out a score.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he was grasped by the foot,
and a voice rang in his ears: 'Help! help! Oh,
prithee, help!'</p>

<p>In his condition of nervous excitation, the
touch, the call, so unexpected, wrung from him
a scream. It was as though a rude hand had
fallen on an exposed nerve.</p>

<p>Again a tighter clasp at his foot, again an
entreating cry of intenser entreaty: 'Help! Oh,
prithee, prithee, help!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">BETWEEN TWO LIGHTS</p>

<p class="p1">Zita had run on. Her young heart was full
of the agony of distress for her father.
He was the one object in the world to whom her
heart clung. She had lost her mother early,
and had been accordingly brought up by her
father, who had been father and mother to her
in one. She had no brothers, no sisters. He
had been to her father, mother, brothers, and
sisters in one. The young heart is full of love.
It is of a clinging nature. It may not be
disposed to demonstrativeness, but it loves, it
clings; and it is in despair when the object to
which it has clung, the person it has loved,
fails.</p>

<p>For some little while, for more than the
fortnight of which Zita had spoken, she had
observed that her father was ill, that his powers
were declining.</p>

<p>She had fought against the terrible thought
that she would lose him, whenever with a flash

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>

of horror it had shot through her brain, had
contracted her heart.</p>

<p>Her father! The daily associate; the one person
to whom she could always speak with frankness,
with whom she had had but one interest;
the one person who had watched over her, cared
for her, loved her—that he should be suffering,
that he might be removed! The idea was more
than her young heart could bear. Cheap Jacks
are human beings, they have like feelings to us
who buy not of Cheap Jacks, but of respectable
tradesmen. Cheap Jacks' daughters, though
they have not had the privileges of the moral and
intellectual training that have ours, are nevertheless—human
beings. We admit this tacitly, but
do not think out the truth such an admission
contains—that they have in their natures the
same mixed propensities, in their hearts the same
passions as ourselves—as have our own children.</p>

<p>Now this poor child ran, her pulses beating;
as she ran, with every rush of blood through
her pulses, a fire shot in electric flashes before
her eyes. She continuously cried, 'Help!
help! My father! my daddy!'</p>

<p>Then her breath failed her. She tried to run,
but was forced to stay her feet and gasp for
breath. She could not maintain her pace as
well as call for assistance.</p>

<p>There was a roaring as of the sea over a bar
when the tide is coming in. It was the roar of
her thundering blood in her ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>She had taken the van lantern and had set it
down by her father on the side of the bank.
As she was forced to halt, she looked back.
A shudder came over her. She could not see
the light. Had it expired, and with it, had the
flickering light of life expired in her father?</p>

<p>Then she stepped partly down the bank, and
now she saw the light. From the top she had
not been able to see it owing to the slope, and
for a slight curve in the direction of the canal.
The light that burned by her father's side was
still there. And before her she could see the
sparks in the direction she was pursuing. A
strange medley of lights—were there two or
three or more? She could not count, owing to
her excitement and the tears and sweat that
streamed over her eyes.</p>

<p>She ran on, as the furious throbbing of her
heart was allayed, as her breath returned.</p>

<p>Suddenly—a crash, a flash as of lightning,
and Zita knew not where she was, and for
how long she had been in a state of semi-consciousness.</p>

<p>The poor child, running with full speed, had
run against one of the barriers set up across the
top of the embankment for the prevention of its
employment by wheeled vehicles.</p>

<p>She had struck her head and chest against
the bars, and had been thrown backwards, partly
stunned, completely dazzled by the blow. For
some minutes she lay on the bank confused and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>

in pain. Then she picked herself up, but was
unable to understand what had happened. She
again went forward, and now felt the bars of
timber. She put her hands to them and climbed.
She was sobbing with pain and anxiety; through
her tears she could see the lights in front of
her magnified with prismatic rays shooting from
them. On reaching the top of the barrier she
looked behind her, and again saw the feeble
light from her father's lantern.</p>

<p>Now her senses returned to her, which for a
few moments had been disturbed by the blow
and fall.</p>

<p>She was running to obtain help, shelter for
her dear father. From the top rail she cried,
'Help! help! My daddy! My poor daddy!
Help! help!'</p>

<p>She listened. She thought she heard voices.
Hurt, wearied, breathless, she hoped that the
assistance she had invoked was coming to her
aid.</p>

<p>Should she remain perched where she was,
and wait till the lights in front drew nearer to
her?</p>

<p>Then the fear came over her that she might
not have been heard. The man to whom she
had spoken—he with the one lantern to his
stirrup—had addressed her roughly, had shown
no good feeling, no desire to assist. Was it
likely that he had changed his mind, and was
now returning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>She was confident that the man whom she
had arrested had carried but a single lantern to
his foot. Now as her pulses became more even
in their throb, she was positive that there were
more lights than one before her. She looked
behind her. There was one light by her father,
that was stationary. There were several before
her; and they were in the strangest movement,
flickering here and there, changing places, now
obscured, now shining out, now low, now high,
now on this side, now on that.</p>

<p>She leaped from her place on the rail and
ran on.</p>

<p>Then, coming on an unctuous place in the
marl, where a horse's hoofs had been, where,
perhaps, it had slipped, and, running in a bee-line,
regardless where she went, ignorant of a
slight deviation from the direct line in the
course of the bank, she went down the side, and
plunged into the ice-cold water.</p>

<p>There was a stake, a post in the water. She
clung to that, and, holding it, struggled to get
out. In so doing, she noticed a sort of eye in
the post, a mortice-hole that pierced it, and as
at that moment some of the clouds had parted,
she saw the grey sky and a star shine through
this hole. By means of this post, Zita, whose
strength was almost spent, was able to draw
herself from out of the water. But so exhausted
was she, that, on reaching the top of the bank,
she was constrained to stop and pant for breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Still the thought of her suffering, perhaps
dying, father, urged her on. She saw the
dancing lights close before her, she heard
voices. She felt the embankment tremble
under her feet. Surely some violent commotion
was taking place before her; but what it could
be she had neither time nor power to conjecture.</p>

<p>Then there went by overhead, invisible in the
darkness, a train of wild geese, going south for
the winter, and as they flew they uttered loud,
wild cries, like the barking of hounds in the
clouds—a horrible, startling sound fit to unnerve
any who were unaware of the cause.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood still, listening to the
aerial ghostly sounds. She held her breath.
Then again she ran.</p>

<p>As Zita ran, it seemed to her that assuredly
she saw but two lights. There must have been
but two, and they were stationary. She tried
to call, but her voice failed her; her throat was
parched. She could but run.</p>

<p>Next moment the lights blazed large on her,
and then she grasped a foot. 'Help! help!'</p>

<p class="center">PROFITS</p>

<p class="p1">'WHAT do you want? Who are you?'
asked Ki Drownlands, when he had
sufficiently recovered his self-possession to see
that some one was clinging to him, and that that
person was a woman.</p>

<p>'Help! Come back! Father is ill.'</p>

<p>'I don't care. Let go. You hurt me.'</p>

<p>She hurt him by her touch on his boot! His
nerves were thrilling, and the pressure of her
fingers was unendurable in the surexcitation of
every fibre of his system.</p>

<p>'Oh, help! help!' She would not relax her
hold.</p>

<p>'I cannot. I've my own concerns to
attend.'</p>

<p>Drownlands remained silent for a moment.
He was shivering as one in an ague fit—shivering
as though the marrow in his bones were
touched with frost. Presently he asked in a
voice of constraint—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>'How long have you been here? What have
you seen?'</p>

<p>He stooped to his stirrup, unhitched one of
the lanterns and held it aloft, above the person
who appealed for his aid.</p>

<p>The dim yellow light fell over a head of
thick amber hair and a pale, beautifully moulded
face, with large lustrous eyes, looking up entreatingly
at him.</p>

<p>His hand that held the lantern was unsteady,
and the light quivered. To disguise his agitation,
he gave the lantern a pendulous motion,
and the reflection glinted and went out, glinted
again in those great beseeching eyes, and glowed
in that copper-gold hair, as though waves of
glory flashed up in the darkness and set again
in darkness.</p>

<p>'What have you seen?' he repeated.</p>

<p>'Seen?—I see you. I want help. You will
help me?'</p>

<p>'How long have you been here?'</p>

<p>'How long? I am but this instant come. I
have run.'</p>

<p>Her bosom was heaving under a gay kerchief,
her breath came in little puffs of steam that
passed as golden dust in the halo of the lantern.</p>

<p>Drownlands rested both his hands on the
pommel of the saddle, with the flail athwart
beneath them. He put the handle of the lantern
in his mouth, and the upward glare of the light
was on his sinister face. He was considering.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

He did not recognise the girl. His mind was
too distraught to think whether or not he had
seen her before. She persisted—</p>

<p>'Help us! I have been running. I am out of
breath. I saw you ride by on the bank. I called
to you, and spoke to you there, and you would
do nothing. My dear father is worse. He is
dying. You must—you shall help.'</p>

<p>He still looked at her. That beautiful face—the
sole object shining out of the darkness—fascinated
him, in spite of his alarm, his distress.</p>

<p>'I am Cheap Jack Zita. I am the daughter
of the poor Cheap Jack. He is taken ill—he
cannot get on. He is on the bank—dying.
My father!'</p>

<p>Then she burst into tears; and in the lantern
light Ki saw the sparkling drops race down the
smooth cheeks, saw them rise in the great eyes
and overflow. He slowly removed the lantern
handle from his teeth, and said—</p>

<p>'I cannot be plagued with you. I have other
matters that concern me.'</p>

<p>He had been alarmed at first, fearing lest his
encounter with Runham had been witnessed,
lest this girl should be able to testify against
him, were he taken to task for the death of his
rival and adversary.</p>

<p>'Oh, come! Oh, do come!' sobbed Zita, as
she grasped his boot more tightly.</p>

<p>'It was you who called?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it was I.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>'You called me?'</p>

<p>'Yes. There was no one else to call.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said he, 'you saw no one else? No
one with me?'</p>

<p>'No. I ran up the bank as you went by. I
spoke to you, but you swore at me.'</p>

<p>'I—I did that?'</p>

<p>There was some mistake. She had taken
him for the man now beneath the water.</p>

<p>'You shall not go!' cried the girl, clinging
desperately to the stirrup. 'You cannot be so
heartless as to let my poor father die.'</p>

<p>'What is your father to me? Let go.'</p>

<p>'I will not let go.'</p>

<p>He pricked his horse on; but she held to the
bridle and arrested it.</p>

<p>'Take care!' said Drownlands. 'I will not
be stayed against my will.'</p>

<p>She clung to the bridle.</p>

<p>'You may ride over me, and kill me too.
I will not let go.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked he, with a gasp.
'What do you mean by "kill me too"?'</p>

<p>'You shall ride over me, but I shall not
let go.'</p>

<p>'But why did you say "kill me too"?' he
asked threateningly.</p>

<p>'I will die as well as my father. I do not
care to live if he die. How can you leave
him? how can you be so cruel?' She broke
forth into vehemence that shook her whole

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

frame, and shook the horse whose bridle she
grappled.</p>

<p>'What's that?' asked Drownlands, as the
horse stumbled.</p>

<p>He held up the lantern.</p>

<p>On the embankment, under the horse's feet,
lay the flail that had been twisted into his tiger-skin.</p>

<p>'I know you—I know you,' said the girl. 'It
was you who bought the flail.' Then again,
'My father is ill. He is sitting on the bank;
he cannot walk. He will die of the cold if you
do not help.'</p>

<p>'Let go,' shouted Drownlands, 'or I'll bring
the flail down on your hands.'</p>

<p>'You may break them. I will cling with my
teeth.'</p>

<p>He brandished the flail angrily.</p>

<p>Then Zita bowed herself, picked up the second
flail, and, planting herself across the way,
said—</p>

<p>'You are bad and you are cruel. I cannot
get you to come to my father for the asking.
I will drive you to him—drive you with the
flail; I will force you to go.'</p>

<p>He tried to pass the girl, but she would not
budge; and before the whirling flapper and her
threatening attitude, the horse recoiled and
almost threw himself and his rider down the
embankment into the drove.</p>

<p>Drownlands uttered a curse, and again

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

attempted to push past, but was again driven
back by Zita.</p>

<p>'Take care, or I will ride you down,' he
threatened; then shivered, as he recalled how
that a few minutes previously Jake Runham
had used the same threat to him.</p>

<p>He considered a moment.</p>

<p>He could not allow this girl to retain the flail
she had picked up. It was evidence against
him. Every one in Burnt Fen, every one in
Weldenhall and Soham Fens, would hear of the
contest at Ely before the Cheap Jack van. If
that flail were known to have been found on the
embankment, it would be known at once where
it was that Runham fell into the Lark. It might
be surmised that a struggle had there taken
place, and marks of the struggle would be
looked for.</p>

<p>The girl who stood before Drownlands was
the sole person who could by any possibility
appear as witness against him—could prove
that he had been on the spot where Runham
had perished; and this girl was now appealing
to him for help. It was advisable that she
should be conciliated—be placed under an
obligation to himself.</p>

<p>He made no further attempt to pass her; he
made no attempt to fulfil his threat that he
would ride her down.</p>

<p>In a lowered tone he said, 'Where is your
father?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>'A little way back,' answered Zita. 'How far
back I cannot say. I ran—I ran.'</p>

<p>'I will go with you. Give me up that flail.'</p>

<p>'No,' she answered; 'I do not trust you. You
would ride away when you had it.'</p>

<p>'I swear to you that I will not do that.'</p>

<p>She shook her head, retained the flail, slung it
over her shoulder, and walked at his side.</p>

<p>Had she seen the contest? Had she seen him
beat his adversary down—down into the river?
Drownlands asked himself these questions repeatedly,
and was tempted to question her, but
shrank from so doing lest he should awake
suspicions. He need not have feared that. Her
whole mind was occupied with a single thought—her
dying father.</p>

<p>Drownlands riding, the Cheap Jack girl walking,
retraced the path in the direction of Ely.
Not for a moment would she relax her hold
on the bridle, for she could not trust the good
faith of the rider. The river was stealing by,
the current so sluggish that it seemed hardly to
move. It made no ripple on the bank, no lapping
among the reeds. It had no curl of a smile
on its face, no undulation on its bosom. It was
a river that had gone to sleep, and was on the
verge of the stagnation of death. Ki found himself
wondering how far during the night the
man and horse who had gone in would be swept
down. He wondered whether it were possible
that one or other had succeeded in making

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

his way out. He had heard no sound; it
was hardly possible that either could have
escaped.</p>

<p>Presently a jerk on the reins roused Drownlands
from his meditations, and he felt his horse
descend the bank, guided by the girl. In the
darkness he could see a still darker object,
which the faint light from a lantern on the bank
partially illumined, along with a motionless
horse, which seemed of very stubbornness to
be transformed to wood. When, however, the
beast heard the steps of its mistress, it turned
its head and looked stonily towards her, with a
peculiar curl of the nose and protrusion of the
lower lip that was a declaration of determined
resistance to being made to move forward.
Zita paid no attention to the horse. She called
to her father, and received a faint response.</p>

<p>'You will not leave me now? you will help?—you
swear?' said she, turning to the rider.</p>

<p>'No,' answered Ki; 'now that I am here, I am
at your service to do for you what I can.'</p>

<p>He dismounted and attached his horse by the
bridle to the back of the van, then took one of
his lanterns, and went to where he heard Zita
speaking to her father.</p>

<p>'I be bad, Zit—bad—tremenjous. I be done
for,' said the Cheap Jack. 'It's no good saying
"Get along." I can't; there's the fact. I be
stuck—just as the van be. I seems to have no
wish but to be let alone and die slick off.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>'You shall not do that, father. Here is one
of the gentlemen as bought the flails of us. He
will help.'</p>

<p>Then Drownlands came to the side of the sick
man and inquired, 'What is it? What can I
do for you?'</p>

<p>'I don't know as I want nort,' answered the
Cheap Jack; 'nort but to be let alone to die.
Don't go and worrit me, that's all.'</p>

<p>'My farm is not a mile distant,' said Ki.
'Get into the waggon and drive along.'</p>

<p>'I can't abear the joggle,' answered the Cheap
Jack. 'I wants to go nowhere. But whatever
will become of Jewel and Zit?'</p>

<p>He groaned, sighed, and turned over on the
bank towards the scanty grass and short moss
that covered the marl, and laid his face in that.
The girl held his hand, and knelt by him.
Presently he raised his head and said, 'Arter all,
Zit, we did a fine business, what wi' the tea and
what wi' the flails. Them as didn't cost us
eighteenpence sold for one pun' thirteen and six—tremenjous!'</p>

<p>'Now listen to me,' said Drownlands. 'This
horse of yours will never be able to get the van
along. I will ride home and fetch a team, and
we'll have the whole bag of tricks conveyed to
Prickwillow in a jiffy. I'll bring help, and we'll
lift you on to a feather tye.'</p>

<p>'You will not play me false?' asked Zita.</p>

<p>'Not I,' answered Ki, as he picked up the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

second flail; 'trust me. I shall be back in half
an hour.'</p>

<p>He mounted his horse and rode away. The
girl watched him as he departed with some
anxiety; then, as he departed into the darkness,
Zita seated herself on the bank, and endeavoured
to raise her father, that his head might repose
on her bosom. He looked at her and put his
arm about her neck.</p>

<p>'You've been a good gal,' said he. 'You've
done your dooty to the wan and the 'oss and
me, and I bless you for it. That there tea as
we made out o' sweepins as we bought at
London Docks, and out o' blackthorn leaves as
we picked off the hedges and dried on the top
of the wan—'twas a fine notion, that. Go on as
I've taught you, Zit, and you'll make a Cheap
Jack o' the right sort. One pun' thirteen and
six for them flails! That's about one pun'
twelve profits. What's us sent into the world
for but to make profits? I've done my dooty
in it. I've made profits. I feel a sort o' in'ard
glow, just as if I wos a lantern wi' a candle in
me, when I thinks on it. One pun' twelve—I
say, Zit, what's that per cent.? I can't calkerlate
it now; it's gone from me. One pun' twelve is
thirty-two. And thirty-two to one and an 'arf'—He
heaved a long sigh. 'I be bad—I can't
calkerlate no more.'</p>

<p>Zita leaned over the sick man's face, and with
the corner of her gaily figured and coloured

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

kerchief wiped his brow. His mind was wandering.
From silence and impatience of being
spoken to and having to exert himself to speak,
he had come to talk, and talk much, in rambling
strains.</p>

<p>'Father, I've brought you some brandy from
the van. Take a drop. It may revive you.'</p>

<p>She put a flask to his lips. He found a difficulty
in swallowing, and turned his face away.
He had raised his head to the flask with an
effort; it sank back on his daughter's bosom.</p>

<p>'Dad, how wet your hair is!'</p>

<p>'Things ain't as they ort to be,' said the Cheap
Jack sententiously. 'I've often turned the world
over in my head and seed as the wrong side comes
uppermost. Then I'm sure I was ordained to
be a mimber o' parliament, but I never got a
chance to rise to it. How I could ha' talked the
electors over into believin' as black was white!
How I could ha' made 'em a'most swallow anything
and believe it was apricot jam! I could
ha' told 'em lies enough to carry me to the top
o' the poll by a thumping majority. It's lies
does it, all the world over—leastways with the
general public in England. It's lies sells
damaged goods. It's lies as makes 'em turn
their pockets out into your lap. It's lies as
carries votes. It's lies as governs the land.
The general public likes 'em. It loves 'em.
They be as sweet and dear to the general public
as thistles is to asses.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he lay quiet, except only that he turned
his head from side to side, as though looking at
something.</p>

<p>'What is it, dad?'</p>

<p>'I thinks as I sees 'em—miles and miles,
going right away into nothing at all.'</p>

<p>'What, father?'</p>

<p>'The hawthorn hedges in full bloom, white
as snow—it's our own tea plantation, Zit, you
know—touched up wi' sweepins. When
the flowers fall, then the leaves will come, and
there'll be profits. Assam, Congou, Kaisow, Darjeeling,
Souchong—just what you like—and, in
truth, hawthorn leaves and sweepins—all alike.
There's profits—profits comin' in the leaves,
Zit.'</p>

<p>A light sleet was falling, and it gleamed in
the radiance of the lantern planted on the bank
near the dying man's head.</p>

<p>'So you see, Zit,' he said, pointing into space,
'the thorn leaves be fallin',—scores o' thousands,—and
the green leaves will come and bring
profits.'</p>

<p>'What you see is snow that is coming down,
father.'</p>

<p>'No, Zit. It's the thorns sheddin' their white
flowers to grow profits. Fall, fall, fall away,
white leaves.'</p>

<p>He remained silent for a while, and then began
to pluck at his daughter with the hand that
clasped her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>'What is it, father?'</p>

<p>'I ain't easy.'</p>

<p>'Shall I lift your head higher?'</p>

<p>' 'Tain't that. It's in my mind, Zit.'</p>

<p>'What troubles you, dad?'</p>

<p>'That tin kettle wi' the hole in it. I've never
stopped it. Put a bit o' cobbler's wax into the
hole and some silverin' stuff over it, and you'll
sell it quick off. Nobody won't find out till they
comes to bile water in it.'</p>

<p>'I'll do that, father. Hush! I hear the horses
coming.'</p>

<p>'I don't want to go wi' them. I hears singing.'</p>

<p>'It is the wind whistling.'</p>

<p>'No, Zit. It be the quiristers chanting in
Ely. Do you hear their psalm?'</p>

<p>'No, we cannot hear them. They do not sing
at night, and are also too distant.'</p>

<p>'But I does hear 'em singing beautiful, and
this is the psalm they sing—"One pun' twelve—and
hawthorn tea at four shillin'. There's
profits."'</p>

<p>He was sinking. He weighed heavy on her
bosom.</p>

<p>She stooped to his ear and whispered, 'Are
you happy, father?'</p>

<p>'Happy? In course I be. One pun' twelve
on them flails, and four shillin' on thorn leaves and
sweepins—there's profits—profits—tremenjous!'</p>

<p>And he spoke no more.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">MARK RUNHAM</p>

<p class="p1">NO sight in the Fens is so solemn, so touching,
as a funeral. There are no graveyards
in the Fens. There is no earth to which
the dead can be committed—only peat, and this
in dry weather is converted into dust, and in rain
resolved into a quagmire. A body laid in it
would be exposed by the March winds, soddened
by the November rains.</p>

<p>Consequently the dead are conveyed, sometimes
as many as nine miles, to the islets—to
Ely, to Stuntney, or to Littleport, wherever
there is a graveyard; and a graveyard can only
be where there is an outcrop of blue clay. For
a funeral, the largest cornwain is brought forth,
and to it is harnessed a team of magnificent
cart-horses, trimmed out with black favours.</p>

<p>In the waggon is placed the coffin, and round
it on the wain-boards sit the mourners. The
sorrowful journey takes long. The horses step
along slowly, their unshod feet muffled in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>

dust or mire, and their tread is therefore noiseless.
But their bells jingle, and now and then
a sob breaks forth from one of the mourners.</p>

<p>Two waggons bearing dead men took the
road to Ely. In one sat a single mourner, Zita;
and this waggon preceded the other. The
second was full, and was followed by a train of
labourers who had been in the service of the
deceased, and of acquaintances who had roistered
or dealt with him.</p>

<p>A cold wind piped over the level, and rustled
the harsh dun leaves of the rushes in the
dykes. Royston crows in sable and white
stalked the fields, dressed as though they also
were mourners, but were uninvited, and kept at
a distance from the train. Lines of black windmills
radiated from every quarter of the heavens,
as though they were mourners coming over the
fens from the outermost limits to attend the
obsequies of a true son of the marshland.</p>

<p>To the south-west stood up the isle of Ely,
tufted with trees; and soaring above the trees,
now wan against a sombre cloud, then dark
against a shining sky, rose the mighty bulk of
the minster, its size enhanced by contrast with
the level uniformity of the country.</p>

<p>Although it cannot be said that no suspicion
of foul play was entertained relative to the
death of Jake Runham, yet nothing had transpired
at the coroner's inquest that could in any
way give it grounds on which to rest; nothing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

that could in the smallest degree implicate
Drownlands.</p>

<p>Runham had drunk freely at the tavern at
Ely, and he had ridden away 'fresh,' as a
witness euphemistically termed it, implying
that he was fuddled. He had started on his
home journey with a single lantern, in itself
likely to occasion an accident, for it vividly
illumined one side of the way and unduly
darkened the other. Some one in the tavern
yard had commented on this, and had advised
the extinction of the single light as more calculated
to mislead than none at all.</p>

<p>Horse and man had been discovered in the
water about a mile above the drove that led to
Crumbland, his farm. Runham had been found
with his legs entangled in the stirrups. Possibly,
had he been able to disengage himself when
falling, he might have escaped to land. Certainly
the horse would have found its way out;
but the weight of the rider had prevented the
poor beast from reaching the bank. It was
observed that Runham had gone into the canal
on his right hand, and that the lantern had
been slung to his left foot.</p>

<p>There were, it was noticed, contusions on the
head and body of the deceased, but these were
easily accounted for without recourse to the
supposition of violence. At intervals in the
course of the Lark piles were driven into the
banks to protect them against the lighters, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

horse and man might have been carried by the
stream, or in their struggles, against these
stakes, and thus the abrasions of the skin and
the bruises might have been produced.</p>

<p>Something was, indeed, said about a recent
quarrel between the dead man and his neighbour,
Drownlands; but then, it was asked,
when, for the last nineteen years, had there
been an occasion on which they had met without
quarrelling? The quarrel, according to
report, had been inconsiderable, and had concerned
nothing more than a flail for which both
men had bidden high. Furthermore, Drownlands,
it was ascertained, had been detained on
his way to Prickwillow, before reaching the spot
where the corpse had been found. He had
been detained by the Cheap Jack's daughter
on account of the Cheap Jack's sickness. It
was known that Drownlands had summoned
his men, and with a team of horses had removed
the van to his rickyard. He had been attentive
to the unfortunate vagabond, and had been at
his side till his death.</p>

<p>There was no specifying the exact hour when
Runham had fallen into the water, but, as far as
could be judged, it must have been about the
time when Drownlands was occupied with the
Cheap Jack.</p>

<p>A floating suspicion that Ki might have had
a hand in the death of Jake did exist, but there
was nothing tangible on which a charge could

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

be based. On the contrary, there was a great
deal to show that he was not present; enough
to free him from suspicion.</p>

<p>When the funerals were over,—and both had
taken place simultaneously, the graves being
adjacent, one chaplain performing the service
over both,—then the waggons returned. That
in which the Cheap Jack's coffin had been conveyed
to its last resting-place was empty. Zita
declared her intention to walk.</p>

<p>Those who had walked behind the waggon of
Runham were taken up into it, the horses started
at a trot, and both conveyances were soon far
away, and appeared as specks in the distance.</p>

<p>Zita walked slowly along the road. She was
in no hurry. She had to resolve what she was
to do for her maintenance.</p>

<p>Should she pursue the same trade as her
father? Would it be safe for her to do so? At
times there was a good deal of money in the
van; and if she, a young girl, were alone, she
might be robbed. She had abundance of ready
wit, she had assurance, she had at command the
stock-in-trade of old jokes used by her father,
and was perfectly competent to sell goods and
reap profits. But the purchase of the stock had
been managed by her father, and with that part
of the business she was not conversant. Could
she manage the van and its stores and the horse
alone? If not alone, then whom might she take
into partnership with herself? Not another

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

girl. A man it must be; but a man—that
would not do for other reasons. The girl
coloured as she walked and pondered on the
perplexed question of her future.</p>

<p>She then considered whether it would be
advisable for her to dispose of her van and its
contents. But she saw that she could do so
only at a ruinous loss. Her situation would be
taken advantage of. The damaged goods would
not sell at all, unhelped out in the exaggerations,
lies, the flourish and scuffle of a public auction.
All the articles were not, indeed, like the tin
kettle and the 'own plantation tea.' Some were
really good. A majority were good, but the
collection was spiced with infirm and defective
articles.</p>

<p>If she did dispose of the van and her stock,
what should she do with herself? Into service
she could not go—the bondage would be intolerable.
Into a school she could not go—she had
no education. To become a dressmaker was
not possible—she could not cut out. To enter
a factory of any sort was hardly to be considered.
She knew no trade. She could befool
the general public—that was her sole accomplishment.</p>

<p>As she walked along, musing on her difficulties,
she was caught up by a young man,
dressed in deep mourning. At first he made
as though he would pass her by, for he was
walking at a greater pace than hers, but after a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

few steps in advance he halted, turned back,
and said in a kind tone—</p>

<p>'We are both orphans. You lost your father
on the same night as that on which I lost mine.
They have been buried on the same day, and
the same service has been read over both. I am
Mark Runham; you are the Cheap Jack girl.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am Cheap Jack Zita.'</p>

<p>'I could not call you by any other name;
your real name I did not know. Let us walk
together, unless you desire to be alone.'</p>

<p>'Oh no.'</p>

<p>'When I was in the waggon, with my dead
father in the coffin before me, I looked forward,
and then I saw you—you, poor little thing,
sitting alone, with your head bowed down over
your father's coffin. I thought it infinitely sad.
You were all alone, and I had so many with
me.'</p>

<p>Zita turned her face to him.</p>

<p>'You are very kind,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not at all. My heart is sore because I have
lost my father—but there is so much to take
the sharpness off my pain; I have my mother
alive. And you?'</p>

<p>'My mother has been dead these five years.'</p>

<p>'And I have many relatives, and more friends.
But you?'</p>

<p>'I have none. I am alone in the world.'</p>

<p>'And then I have house and lands. And
you?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>'I have the van.'</p>

<p>'A wandering house—no real house. What
are you going to do with yourself?'</p>

<p>'That is just what I was considering as I
walked along.'</p>

<p>'Will you tell me your plan?'</p>

<p>'I have none. I have not resolved what to
do.'</p>

<p>'I am glad that I have caught you up. I
sent on the waggon. I had to stay behind and
make arrangements with the undertaker and
the clerk. I am glad I remained; it has given
me the opportunity of speaking with you. Our
mutual losses make us fellows in sorrow, and
you seem to me so piteously lonely. Even when
I was in the wain my eyes wandered to you,
and with my eyes went my thoughts. I could
not fail to consider how much greater was your
desolation than mine.'</p>

<p>Again Zita turned to look at the young fellow
who spoke. He had fair hair, bright blue eyes,
a fresh, pleasant face, frank and kindly.</p>

<p>'I think you sold something to my father,' he
said; 'I have heard the chaps talk about it.
You sold it middling dear. A flail—and he
paid a guinea for it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I sold a flail for a guinea, and another
for twelve and six. Mr. Drownlands bought
one of them.'</p>

<p>'And my father the other. I was not at the
fair when that took place, but folk have talked

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>

about it. I think, had I been there, I would
have prevented my father bidding so high. The
flail was not found with him when he was
recovered from the river.'</p>

<p>'No; it was on the bank.'</p>

<p>'It was probably carried down by the Lark,'
said he, not noticing her words, 'and went out
in the Wash.'</p>

<p>The flail! Zita was surprised. One flail she
knew that Drownlands held when she met him,
the other she had herself picked up, and had
used to prevent him from continuing his course,
and to compel him to assist her father.</p>

<p>She stood still and considered. The matter
was, however, of no consequence, so she stepped
on. If she found the flail at Prickwillow, she
would take it to Crumbland. It belonged to
Mark Runham by right.</p>

<p>'What is it?' asked the young man, surprised
at her look of concentrated thought.</p>

<p>'It is nothing particular,' she answered; 'something
occurred to me—that is all. But it is of
no matter.'</p>

<p>'I should like to know what is going to
become of you,' said the young man. 'Have
you no kindred at all?'</p>

<p>'None that I know of.'</p>

<p>'And no home?'</p>

<p>'None, as I said, but the van. When that is
sold, I shall have none at all.'</p>

<p>'But you have friends?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>'A friend—yes—Jewel, the old horse. Well,
he ain't so old, neither. I call him old because
I love him.'</p>

<p>'I say, when you've made up your mind what
to do with yourself, come to our farm, Crumbland,
and tell me.'</p>

<p>'That's blazin' impudence,' said Zita. 'If
you want to know, you can come and ask of
me.'</p>

<p>'I cannot do that. Do you not know that
my father and Ki Drownlands were mortal
enemies? I cannot set foot on his soil, or he
would prosecute me for trespass. If I went to
his door, I would be met with something more
than bad words.'</p>

<p>'Why were they enemies?'</p>

<p>'I do not know. They have been enemies as
long as I can remember anything. Well, you
will let me have some tidings concerning you.
I will come out on the embankment near Prickwillow,
and you can come there too. It is so
dreadful that you should have no one to care
for you, and no place as a home to go to. If I
can help you in any way tell me. My mother
is most kind. As it has chanced that we have
both been made orphans at one time, and as
our two fathers were buried, as one may say,
together, and as we are walking home together,
it seems to me that it would be wrong and
heartless were I to do nothing for you. To sit
and nestle into my home and comforts at Crumbland

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>

and see you wander forth desolate and
alone—the Pharisee couldn't have done half so
bad with the poor man by the wayside, and I
won't. I should never forgive myself. I should
never forget the sight of the poor little lass in
black, with the coffin in the great waggon, all
alone.'</p>

<p>'You are kind,' said Zita, touched with the
honest, genuine feeling his tones expressed. 'I
thank you, but I want no help. I have money,
I have goods, I have a horse, and I have a home
on wheels. And I have—what is best of all—a
spirit that will carry me along.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but one little girl is a poor and feeble
thing, and the world is very wide and very
wicked, and terribly strong. I'd be sorry that
this bold spirit of yours were crushed by it.'</p>

<p>'Here is the place where I live,' said Zita.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's Prickwillow drove. Here am I,
eighteen years old, and I have never been along
it—never been on Drownlands farm, along of
this quarrel. And what it was all about, blessed
if I or any one else knows!'</p>

<p>Zita lingered a moment at the branch of the
road. Mark put out his hand, and she took
it.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what,' said she; 'you've been
kind and well-meanin' with me, and I'll give
you a milk-strainer or a blacking-brush, whichever
you choose to have.'</p>

<p>Mark Runham was constrained to laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>'I'll tell you which it is to be next time we
meet; to-morrow on the embankment—just
here. Remember, if you are short of anything
beside a milk-strainer or a blacking-brush—it
is yours.'</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">PRICKWILLOW</p>

<p class="p1">A SLEEPLESS night followed the day of
the funeral. Zita needed rest, but obtained
none. She had brain occupied by care
as well as heart reduced by sorrow. She had
loved her father, the sole being in the world to
whom she could cling, her sole stay. The
wandering life she had led prevented her contracting
friendships. Since her father's death
she had lain at night in the van. This conveyance
was so contrived as to serve many purposes.
It was a shop, a kitchen, a parlour, an eating-house,
a carriage, a bank. The goods were
neatly packed, and were packed so close that
the inmates could very commodiously live in the
midst of their stores. There was a little cooking
stove in it. There were beds. There was,
indeed, no table, but there were boxes that
served as seats and as tables, and the lap is the
natural dinner-table every man and woman is
provided with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>When the front of the van was raised so as to
shut up the shop for the night, the crimson plush
curtains with their gold fringe and tassels concealed
the board on which so much trade had
been carried on during the day. There was a
window at the back that admitted light. The
stove gave out heat, and the inmates of the
travelling shop settled themselves to their
accounts, and then to rest.</p>

<p>The accounts were calculated not in a ledger,
but on their fingers, and balanced not on paper
but in their heads.</p>

<p>When darkness set in, then a lamp illumined
the interior, and the little dwelling was suffused
with a fragrance of fried onions and liver, or
roast mutton chops—something appetising and
well earned; something for which the public
had that day paid, and paid through its nose.
The horse had been attended to, and then the
father sat on a bench, pipe in mouth and legs
stretched out, and occasionally removed the pipe
that he might inhale the fumes of the supper his
daughter was preparing. Cheap Jack had
possessed a fund of good spirits, and his good
humour was never ruffled. He had been the
kindest of fathers; never put out by a mishap,
never depressed by a bad day's trade, never
without his droll story, song, or joke. But for
a fortnight before his death he had failed in
cheeriness and flagged in conversation. The
work of the day had become a burden instead

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>

of a pleasure, and had left him so weary that he
could often not eat his supper or relish his pipe.</p>

<p>He had combated his declining health, and
endeavoured to disguise the advance of disease
from the eyes of Zita. But love has keen sight,
and she had noted with heartache his gradual
failure of spirits and power. Till then no thought
as to her own future had occupied her mind.
Now that the dear father was gone, Zita had no
one on whom to lean. No other head than her
own would busy itself about her prospects, no
other heart than her own concern itself about
her to-morrow.</p>

<p>She was kindly treated at Prickwillow. The
van was placed under cover, and the horse
provided with a stall.</p>

<p>The housekeeper, a distant relative of Ki
Drownlands, was hearty in her offers of
assistance, and the maid-of-all-work, who was
afflicted with St. Vitus' dance, nodded her kindly
good wishes. Both Drownlands and the housekeeper
had urged Zita to accept the accommodation
of the house, in which were many rooms
and beds, but she had declined the invitation;
she was accustomed to van life, and could make
herself comfortable in her wonted quarters. She
needed little, and the van was supplied with
most things that she required. There were in it
even sufficient black odds and ends to serve her
for mourning at her father's funeral. What was
there not in the van? It was an epitome of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

world, it was a universal mart, a Novgorod Fair
sublimated to an essence.</p>

<p>'What are you about?' asked Drownlands.</p>

<p>He had come into the yard behind the farmhouse,
and he saw Zita engaged in harnessing
the horse. The front was down, and on it stood
a milk-strainer, some blacking-brushes, and a flail.</p>

<p>'What are you about? Whither are you
going?'</p>

<p>Drownlands was a tall man, with a face like a
hawk, and dark bushy brows that stood out over
his eyes and the root of his nose.</p>

<p>'I am going,' answered Zita.</p>

<p>'Going? Who told you to go?'</p>

<p>'I am going to be an inconvenience no longer.'</p>

<p>'Who told you you were an inconvenience?'</p>

<p>'No one, but I know that I am not wanted.
I thank you for what you have done, and will
pay you.'</p>

<p>'Pay me? Who said a word about payment?'</p>

<p>'No one, but of course I pay. Mark Runham—I
think that was his name—was kind to me,—that
is to say, he spoke civil to me,—and I'm
going to pay him for good words with a milk-strainer.
You have done me good deeds, and I
will pay you. Get into the van and pick out
what you like up to five pounds. Do you want
door-mats? There's a roll o' carpet, but I don't
recommend it, and there's tinned goods.'</p>

<p>Drownlands stared at the girl. Then his eyes
rested on the flail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>'What have you got that for? It was in my
house.'</p>

<p>'Yes. You took it in. But it is not yours.
It belongs to Mark Runham. His father bought
it of us. He gave a guinea for it. I picked it
up on the bank when I overtook you. You had
your flail in your hand. You would have ridden
on and left me and my father in the lurch, but I
stood in the way with that flail. It is not mine.
I have the guinea I received for it in my purse.
Now that the old man is dead, for certain it
belongs to his son. That is why I am taking
it to him.'</p>

<p>'He shall not have it! He must not have
it!' exclaimed Drownlands. 'How came you
to know Mark Runham?'</p>

<p>'The young man walked from his father's
funeral. So did I. He walked the fastest, and
he caught me up. He spoke kindly, and so I
shall pay him for it with a milk-strainer, or, if
he prefers it, with blacking-brushes.'</p>

<p>'Give him the blacking-brushes, by all means.'</p>

<p>'Or the milk-strainer?'</p>

<p>'Or the milk-strainer; but not the flail.'</p>

<p>'It is his,' said Zita. 'The old man paid down
his money for it.'</p>

<p>'Give him back the money, not the flail.
Here'—</p>

<p>Drownlands thrust his hand into his pocket,
and drew a handful of money, gold, silver, copper,
mixed, from it, and extended it to the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>'Here! you said you would pay me for what
I have done. Pay me with the flail. I want
nothing more. Then I have the pair; or if you
wish to restore the guinea—take it.'</p>

<p>'The flail was bought. It is no longer mine.'</p>

<p>Drownlands stamped, put out his hand and
snatched the flail from the board on which it
stood.</p>

<p>'He shall not have it. I will accept nothing
else.'</p>

<p>'Then I must give the young man its value—a
guinea's worth of goods.'</p>

<p>'Do so, and take the pay from me.'</p>

<p>'I will let him have your mats, and I'll tell
him that you'—</p>

<p>'Tell him nothing. Not a word about the
flail. That is all I ask of you. Say nothing.
If you owe me anything for what I have done
for your father and you, then pay me by your
silence.' He mused for a moment, then caught
the girl by the arm and drew her after him.
'Come and see all I have.'</p>

<p>He led her athwart the rickyard to where
were ranged his stacks of wheat—two, each
forty paces long, with a lane between them.
Down this lane he conducted her. 'Look,' said
he, 'did you ever see such ricks as these? No,
nowhere out of the Fens. Do you know how
much bread is in them? No, nor I. It would
take you many years to eat your way through
them; and every year fresh wheat—as much as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>

this—grows. There are rats and mice in these
stacks. They sit therein and eat their fill, they
rear their families there. What odds is that to
me? A few more rats and mice—a few more
mouths in the house—I care not. There is
plenty for all.' Then he drew Zita into another
yard that was full of young stock, bullocks and
heifers.</p>

<p>'Look here,' said he. 'Do you see all these?
How much meat is on them? How long would
it take you to eat them? Whilst you were
eating, others would be coming—that is the
way of Nature. Nature outstrips us; it shovels
in with both hands, whilst we take out with
one—so is it, anyhow, in the Fens. What is
another cut off a round of beef to such as me?'</p>

<p>Then he strode to the stables, threw open
the door, and said, 'There are stalls for horses;
there is hay in the loft to feed them, oats in the
bins to nourish them. What odds to me if there
be one more horse in the stalls? Here!' he
called to one of his men. 'Take the Cheap
Jack horse out of the van-shafts again and
bring him to this stable.'</p>

<p>Zita endeavoured to free herself from his grasp.</p>

<p>'No,' said Drownlands; 'you have not seen
all. You have been about the world, I daresay;
seen plenty of sights; but there is one
thing you have not seen before,—a fen-farm,—and
it is a sight to unseal your eyes. Come
along with me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He held her wrist with the grip of a vice,
and now drew her in the direction of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>'Look!' said he. 'What is that? That is
our fuel. That is turf. What do we pay for
keeping ourselves warm in winter? Nothing.
I have heard say that some folks pay a pound
and even forty shillings for a ton of sea-coal.
And for wood they will pay a guinea a load.
We pay nothing. The fuel lies under our feet.
We take off a spit of earth, and there it is for
the digging, some ten—fifteen—twenty feet of
it. It costs us no more than the labour of
taking up. Do I want a bit of brass? I go to
market, and say I have ten acres of turf to sell
at sixty pounds an acre. A dozen hands are
held up. I get six hundred pounds at once.
That is what I call making money. Come on.
You have not seen all yet.'</p>

<p>He drew her farther. He pulled her up the
steps to the door, then turned, and, pointing to
a large field in which were mounds of clay at
short intervals, he said—</p>

<p>'Do you see that? What is done elsewhere
when land is hungry, and demands a dressing?
Lime is brought to fertilise the exhausted soil.
We in the Fens never spend a shilling thus.
If we desire dressing, we dig under the turf, and
there it lies—rich, fat clay—and spread that
over the surface. That is what it is to have a
fen-farm. Come within now.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He conducted Zita through the door, and
threw open the dairy.</p>

<p>'Look,' said he. 'See the milk, the churns,
the butter. Everything comes to us in the
Fens. Butter is a shilling a pound, and there
are twenty-eight pounds there now. There will
be as much next churning, and all goes as fast
as made. Touch that churn. Every time you
work it you churn money. Come on with me
farther.'</p>

<p>He made the girl ascend the stairs, and as he
went along the passage at the head of the staircase,
he threw open door after door.</p>

<p>'Look in. There are many rooms; not half
of them are occupied, but all are furnished.
Why should I stint furniture? I have money—money!
See!' He drew her into a small
apartment, where were desk and table and
chairs. It was his office. He unlocked a safe
in the wall.</p>

<p>'See! I have money here—all gold. Come
to the window.'</p>

<p>Drownlands threw open the casement. Below
was the yard, in which were the young cattle,
trampling on straw and treading it into mire.
He thrust his hand into his pocket, drew forth
a handful of coins, and, without looking what
he held,—whether gold, or silver, or copper,—he
threw it broadcast over the bullocks and
heifers. Some coins struck the backs of the
beasts, and bounded off them and fell among

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>

the straw, some went down into the mud, and
was kneaded in by their feet.</p>

<p>'What is money to me? It grows, it forces
itself on me, and I know not what to do with
it. I can throw it away to free myself of the
trash and more comes. It comes faster than I
can use it; faster than I can cast it away. Now,
girl—Cheap Jack girl—now you know what a
fen-farm is. Now you see what a fen-tiger
can do. You remain at Prickwillow with me.
I will shelter you, feed you, clothe you, care for
you. Eat, drink, sleep, laugh, and play. Work
a little. All is given to you ungrudgingly.'</p>

<p>He put the flail to his knee and endeavoured
to break it, but failed. Then he cast it into the
corner of the room, where was a collection of
whips, sticks, and tools.</p>

<p>'There,' said he, 'all I ask is—not a word
about my having been on the embankment.
Not a word about the flail—least of all to
Runham. I have my reasons, which you do
not understand, and which you need not know.'</p>

<p>Zita hesitated. She had not expected such
an offer. She doubted whether she could contentedly
settle into farm life.</p>

<p>'You were about to leave,' continued Drownlands,
'or rather to try to leave. But how could
that horse of yours draw the van out of the
Fens? You know how it was when you came
this way. The wheels sank, and the horse was
powerless. I sent my team, and only so could

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

we draw the van along. Never, unassisted,
could you reach Littleport or Ely, not, at all
events, in winter. When you got into the drove
the wheels would sink again, and I should send
my team and drag the van back here once
more. You have got your feet into the peat
earth and clay, and are held fast. Listen to me.
Supposing you did get a little way and then
stick, and I were angry at your departure, and
refused to come to your aid and draw you back
to Prickwillow, what then? Let me tell you
what would happen were you left out all night
unprotected, sunk to the axle in the fen. There
are slodgers in the fen; there are tigers, as they
call them here—plenty round Littleport. That
story of the sale of the flails is spread and talked
about. It is known that you have money. It
is known that your father is dead. Do you
think there are not men who, for the sake of
what money you have, would not scruple to
steal on you in the dark, to come up like rats
out of the dykes, like foxes from the holes, and
take your money, and nip that brown throat
of yours to prevent peaching? If you think
there are not, then you think differently of the
Fens and the fen-men than do I who have
lived in the Fens and among the tigers all my
days. Come'—</p>

<p>He put his hand to her throat and pinched
it.</p>

<p>'This, and your body found in a drain, black

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>

in fen-water, of a morning. This on one side;
on the other, my offer of a home, protection—everything.'</p>

<p>Zita withdrew from his grasp with a shudder.</p>

<p>'I accept your offer,' she said; 'I can do no
other. There is no choice in the matter.'</p>

<p>'You are right there,' said he, with a laugh.
'To you there is no choice.'</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">RED WINGS</p>

<p class="p1">DAYS passed; Zita had settled into Prickwillow.
She was given her own room,
and into that she removed the contents of the
van. The walls were lined with the stock in
trade, and the crimson and gold curtains festooned
the window.</p>

<p>A chamber in a farmhouse seemed to Zita
bare and comfortless after the well-covered
interior of the shop on wheels. She could not
rest till she had hidden the naked walls, and
brought her room into some resemblance to the
interior of the rolling house she had inhabited
for so many years. But she had further reasons
for accumulating the stores in her own apartment.
The van was in an outhouse, and was
exposed to damp, with its attendant evils, moth,
rust, and mildew, that would make havoc of her
property if exposed to them.</p>

<p>Zita made herself useful in the house. She
considered that she could not accept the offer

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>

made her of shelter and sustenance without
acknowledgment of a practical nature, and as
she was endowed with energy and intelligence,
she speedily adapted herself to the work of a
farmhouse. She found that there was need
for her hand. The housekeeper was without
system, and disposed to abandon to the morrow
whatever did not exact immediate attention.
The maid with St. Vitus' dance was a worker,
but required direction. Zita had been compelled
to be tidy through the exigencies of van
life. In the travelling shop a vast number of
very various goods had to be packed into a small
compass, and the claims of trade had obliged
her to keep every article in the brightest condition,
that it might look its best, and sell—if
possible—for more than its intrinsic value.
Accordingly, not only did Zita see that everything
was in its place, but also that everything
was furbished to its brightest. She was nimble
with her fingers in plying the needle, and took
in hand the household linen, hemmed the sheets,
attached buttons, darned holes, and put into
condition all that was previously neglected, and
through neglect had become ragged, and was
falling to premature decomposition.</p>

<p>The girl noticed that Drownlands watched
her at her work, but she also saw that he
averted his eyes the moment she gave token
that she perceived his observation; she was
aware, not only that she interested him, but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

that he, in a manner and in a measure, feared
her.</p>

<p>She had a difficult course to steer with Leehanna
Tunkiss, the housekeeper, who had received
the tidings that Zita was to become an
inmate of the house for some length of time,
with doubt, if not disapproval. The woman,
moreover, resented the improvements made by
the girl as so many insults offered to herself.
To hem what had been left ragged was to proclaim
to Drownlands and to the quaking help-maid,
that Leehanna had neglected her duty; to
sew on a button that had been off the master's
coat for a week, was to exhibit a consideration
for his interests superior to her own.</p>

<p>At the outset, before the funeral, the woman
had been gracious, believing that Zita was but
a temporary lodger. When she found that she
was likely to become a permanent resident, her
manner towards her completely altered.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when Zita had nothing particular
to engage her, she wandered along the
drove, and then rambled from it across the
fields.</p>

<p>A frost had set in on the day of her father's
funeral, and had ever since held the earth in
fetters. It was one of those severe frosts that
so often arrive in November, and sweep away
the last traces of summer, clear the trees of the
lingering leaves, and then sere the grass that is
still green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one of those early frosts which
frequently prove as severe as any that come
with the New Year. The clods and the ruts of
the drove were rigid as iron. It would have
been difficult to move the van when the way was
a slough, it was impossible now that it was
congealed. The lumps and the depressions
were such as no springs could stand, and no
goods endure. Pots would be shivered to atoms,
and pans be battered out of shape. Whatever
Zita may have desired, perhaps hoped, she
recognised the impossibility of leaving her
present quarters under existing circumstances.
A thaw must relax the soil, harrows and rollers
must be brought over the road, before a wheeled
conveyance could pass over it. Finding it
difficult, painful even, to walk in the drove,
where there was not a level surface on which
the foot could be planted, Zita deserted it for a
field, and then struck across country towards
a mill, the sails of which, of ochre-red, were
revolving rapidly. The fields are divided, one
from another, by lanes of water. The fen-men
all leap, and pass from field to field by bounds—sometimes
making use of leaping-poles.
With these latter they can clear not the ditches
only, but the broad drains or loads.</p>

<p>Zita was curious to see a mill. From one
point she counted thirty-six, stretching away in
lines to the horizon. She had hitherto known
windmills only for grinding corn. Here the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>

number was too considerable, and their dimensions
too inconsiderable, for such a purpose.</p>

<p>Lightly leaping the dykes, she made her way
towards the red-winged mill. As she approached,
she saw that the mill was larger than the rest,
that it had a tuft of willows growing beside it,
and that, on an elevated brick platform, whereon
it was planted, stood as well a small house,
constructed, like the mill, of boards, and tarred.
This habitation was a single storey high, and
consisted, apparently, of one room.</p>

<p>On the approach of Zita, a black dog, standing
on the platform with head projected, began
to bark threateningly. Zita drew near notwithstanding,
as the brute did not run at her, but
contented itself with protecting the platform,
access to which it was prepared to dispute.</p>

<p>Then Zita exclaimed, 'What, Wolf! Don't
you know me? Haven't you been cheap-jacking
with us for a couple of months, since father
took you off the knife-swallowing man? We'd
have kept you, old boy, but didn't want to have
to pay tax for you, so sold you, Wolf.'</p>

<p>The dog had not at first recognised Zita in
her black frock; now, at the sound of her voice,
it bounded to her and fawned on her.</p>

<p>A girl now came out from the habitation,
called, 'What is it, Wolf?' and stood at the
head of the steps that led to her habitation,
awaiting Zita.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' asked the girl on the platform

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

She was a sturdy, handsome young woman,
with fair hair, that blew about her forehead in
the strong east wind. Over the back of her
head was a blue kerchief tied under her chin,
restraining the bulk of her hair, but leaving
the front strands to be tossed and played with
by the breeze. She was, in fact, that Kainie
whose acquaintance we have already made.</p>

<p>'I believe that I know who you are,' she said.</p>

<p>She had folded her arms, and was contemplating
her visitor from the vantage-ground of
the brick pedestal that sustained mill and cot.
'You are the Cheap Jack girl, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I am Cheap Jack Zita. And who are
you?'</p>

<p>'I—I was christened Kerenhappuch, but
some folks call me Kainie and Kenappuch.
I answer to all three names. It's no odds to
me which is used. What do you want here?'</p>

<p>'I have come to look at the mill. What is its
purpose? You do not grind corn?'</p>

<p>'Grind corn? You're a zany. No; we
drive the water up out of the dykes into the
drains. Come and see. Why, heart alive!
where have you been? What a fool you must
be not to know what a mill is for! Step up.
Wolf won't bite now he has recognised you.
If you'd been some one else, and tried to step up
here, and me not given the word to lie still, he'd
have made ribbons of you.' She waved her
arms towards the low wooden habitation. 'I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

lives there, I does, and so did my mother afore
me. Some one must mind the mill, and a
woman comes cheaper than a man. Besides,
it ain't enough work for a man, and when a
man hasn't got enough work, why, he takes to
smoking and drinking. We women is different;
we does knitting and washing. We's superior
animals in that way, we is. Here I am a stick-at-home.
I go nowhere. I have to mind the
mill. You are a rambler and a roll-about—never
in one place. It's curious our coming to
know one another. What is your name, did
you say?'</p>

<p>'Zita—Cheap Jack Zita.'</p>

<p>'Zita? That's short enough. No wonder
with such a name you're blowed about light as
a feather. It'd take a thundering gale to send
Kerenhappuch flying along over the face of the
land. Her name is enough to weight her. Now,
what do you want to see? Where does your
ignorance begin?'</p>

<p>'It begins in plain blank. I know nothing
about mills.'</p>

<p>'My mill is Red Wings. If you look along
the line to Mildenhall and count ten, then you'll
see Black Wings. Count eight more, and you
have White Wings.'</p>

<p>The girl threw open a door and entered the
fabric of the mill, stepping over a board set
edgewise. She was followed by Zita.</p>

<p>Nothing could be conceived more simple,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

nothing more practical, than the mechanism of
the mill. The sails set a mighty axletree in
motion, that ran the height of the fabric, and
this beam in its revolution turned a wheel at the
bottom, that made a paddle revolve outside the
mill. This paddle was encased in a box of
boards, and at first Zita could not understand the
purpose of the mechanism, not seeing the paddle.</p>

<p>'Would you like to climb?' asked Kainie.
'Look! I go up like a squirrel. You had best
not attempt it. If your skirts were to catch in
the cogs, there'd be minced Cheap Jack for
Wolf's supper. I'm not afraid. My skirts
seem to know not to go near the wheels, but
yours haven't the same intelligence in them.
A woman's clothes gets to know her ways.
Mine, I daresay, 'd be terrible puzzled in that
van of yours.'</p>

<p>'Don't you talk to me about petticoats,' said
Zita. 'Petticoats to a woman is what whiskers
is to a cat. They have feeling in them. A
cat never knocked over nothing with his
whiskers, nor does a woman with her skirts if
she ain't a weaker fool than a cat.'</p>

<p>Then up the interior of the mill ran Kainie,
with wondrous agility, playing in the framework,
whilst the huge axletree turned, and the oak
fangs threatened to catch or drag her into the
machinery.</p>

<p>'Do come down,' said Zita. 'I do not like to
see you there.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was in vain that she called; her voice
was drowned in the rush of the sails, the grinding
of the cogs, and the creak of the wooden
building.</p>

<p>Presently Kainie descended, as rapidly as she
had run up the ribs of the mill.</p>

<p>'Mother did not let me do it when she was
alive,' said the mill girl. 'But I did it all the
same. Now, what next? Come and see this.'</p>

<p>She led Zita outside, and took her to the
paddle-box, flung open a door in it, and exposed
the wheel that was throwing the water from the
'dyke' up an incline into the 'load' at a considerably
higher level.</p>

<p>'It licks up the water just like Wolf, only it
don't swallow it. There's the difference. And
Wolf takes a little, and stops when he's had
enough; but this goes on, and its tongue is
never dry.'</p>

<p>'Does the mill work night and day?'</p>

<p>'That depends. When there's no wind, then
it works neither night nor day, but goes to sleep.
But when there has been a lot of rain, and the
fen is all of a soak—why, then, old Red Wings
can't go fast enough or long enough to please
the Commissioners. Look here; the water has
gone down eighteen inches in the dyke since
this morning. Red Wings has done it. He's
not a bad sort of a chap. He don't take much
looking after. There's a lot of difference in
mills; some are crabbed and fidgety, and some

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

are sly and lazy. Some work on honest and
straight without much looking after, others are
never doing their work unless you stand over
them and give them jaw. It's just the same
with Christians.'</p>

<p>'And what is that long pole for?' asked Zita.</p>

<p>'That, Miss Ignorance, is the clog. I can
stop the wings from going round if I handle
that, or I can set the sails flying when I lift the
clog. Come here. I'll teach you how to
manage it.' She instructed Zita in the use of
the clog. 'There!' said she; 'now you can
start the mill as well as I can, or you can stop it
just the same. You've learned something from
me today. I hope you won't forget it.'</p>

<p>'No; I never forget what I am taught.'</p>

<p>'Not that it will be of any use to you,' said
Kainie. 'You're never like to want to set a
mill going.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not; but I know how to do that,
and it is something. There is no telling
whether I may want it or not.'</p>

<p>'It's as easy as giving a whack to the hoss
who draws the van,' said Kainie.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Kainie, after a pause, 'this here
hoss of mine has reins too. Do you see those
two long poles, one on either side, reaching to
his head? Them's the reins; with them I turn
his head about so that he may face the wind.
That's the only way in which my hoss can go.
Now come and see where I live.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>She led the way to her habitation, which was
beyond the sweep of the wings.</p>

<p>'It's small, but cosy,' said Kerenhappuch.
'No one can interfere with me, for Wolf keeps
guard. But, bless you, who'd trouble me? I've
no money. And yet one does feel queer after
such things as have happened.'</p>

<p>'What things?'</p>

<p>'Ah! and it is a wonder to me how you or
any one can abide in the same house with
him.'</p>

<p>'With whom?'</p>

<p>'Why, with Ki Drownlands. Though he be
my uncle, I say it.' The girl's face darkened.
'He never spoke to my mother, his own sister;
never helped her with his gold, and he rich and
we poor. The Commissioners gave us our place,
not Uncle Drownlands.'</p>

<p>'Who are the Commissioners?'</p>

<p>'You are a silly not to know. Every man
who owns a couple of score acres in the Fens
is a Commissioner. And the Commissioners
manage the draining, and levy the rates. They
have their gangers, their bankers, their millers—I'm
one of their millers. No,' said Kainie
vehemently. 'No thanks to Ki Drownlands for
that.' She grasped Zita by the shoulders,
put her mouth to her ear, and said in a half
whisper, 'It was Uncle Ki who killed Jake
Runham.'</p>

<p>Zita drew back and stared at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am sure of it,' said Kainie; 'and there be
others as think so too, but durstn't say it. But
there is nothing hid that shall not come to light.
Some day it will be said openly, and known to
all, that Ki Drownlands did it.'</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>

<p class="center">TIGER-HAIR</p>

<p class="p1">ZITA walked back in the direction of Prickwillow
with a weight on her heart and
her mind ill at ease. Incidents half observed
rose in her memory and demanded consideration—as
in a pool sunken leaves will rise after
a lapse of time and float on the surface. Facts
that had been indistinctly seen and scarce regarded,
now assumed shape and significance.</p>

<p>She recalled the incidents of the night of her
father's death, and marshalled them in order
with that nicety and precision that marked
her arrangement of the goods in the van. She
remembered how that she had seen two men
ride along the bank, one after another, with an
interval of some minutes intervening between
them, as they passed above where she had been
with the van and her father. The first rider
had been furnished with two lanterns to his
feet. She had let him pass without attempting
to arrest him. That man she now knew was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

Hezekiah Drownlands. Then, after a lapse
of some minutes, a second rider had passed,
going in the same direction. He had carried
a single lantern attached to his left stirrup.
To him she had run, him she had brought to
a standstill, and she had asked and been refused
his assistance. That man was Jeremiah
Runham.</p>

<p>Zita next recalled every particular of her
run along the bank after the second rider. She
now distinctly remembered having seen a glitter
of several lights before her, a cluster of lights
leaping and falling, flashing and disappearing.
How many these had been she could not recall.
They had changed position, they were not all
visible at once. At the time, in her distress of
mind, she had not counted them. But she was
now convinced that the lights which she had
seen, and seen in one constellation, had been
more than two. A single star would have
represented Runham. Two stars would have
indicated Drownlands. More than two—that
showed that the men had been together.
Further, she had heard shouts and cries. At
the time, as she ran, she had supposed that
these were in response to her appeals for assistance;
but when she had reached Drownlands,
the only man on the bank she did come upon,
then, as she now recalled, he was startled at her
appearance, as if it were wholly unexpected.
He could not, therefore, have called in answer

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

to her cries. But where was the third light?
What had become of Runham?</p>

<p>When she had reached Drownlands no third
light was visible, whereas a minute previously
there had certainly been more than two before
her. What had become of the second rider?</p>

<p>It was, of course, conceivable at the time that
the third light had been extinguished, and the
second rider was in full career along the bank
in the direction he desired to go. But such an
explanation was no longer admissible when it
was known that this rider was dead, and had
been drowned in the river. When Zita considered
that this rider, Runham, had been found
in the water, with the light of life as well as
that of his lantern extinguished, and when she
remembered that she had picked up the flail he
had been carrying at the spot where she came
up with Drownlands, it appeared certain to her
that Drownlands must have witnessed, if he
did not cause, the death of Runham. It was
possible that Runham, returning tipsy from
market, may have urged his horse on one side,
so as to pass the man before him, and so have
plunged into the river; and it was possible
enough that Drownlands had chosen to maintain
silence on the matter, lest any admissions
on his part might have been construed into an
accusation of having caused the death of his
adversary.</p>

<p>Zita was turning these thoughts over in her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

mind when she reached the embankment. She
started to walk along it. She was confident
that she could fix the spot where she had
slipped into the water, and that was but about
a hundred paces from where she had come up
with Drownlands. She remembered to have
observed there a post in the water that had in
it a mortice-hole, like an eye, and that the
head was so indented and rugged as at one
moment to make her suppose it was a human
face.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, there had been
sufficient frost to harden mud into rock. Traces
of a scuffle—if a scuffle had taken place—would
be recognisable still to an eye that knew precisely
where to look for them.</p>

<p>Zita went with nimble feet, a busy brain, and
fluttering heart towards the point where the van
had been arrested in the mud, and she resolved
thence to follow the course she had taken on
that eventful night along the bank. On this
occasion she walked deliberately where she had
previously run, and came after a while to the
spot where, according to her calculation, she had
slipped into the canal. There she found the
post standing up out of the water to which she
had clung, close to the bank, with the mortice-hole
in it that had looked so like a human eye.
This was the only post of the kind she had
come across, and this was not more than a
hundred yards from the spot where she had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>

grasped Drownlands' foot, had held him, and
had heard him scream at her touch.</p>

<p>At this point, some hundred yards beyond the
post with the hole in it, she carefully explored
the soil. The top of the embankment was indented
with hoof-marks, but these might have
been made by the gangers' horses, which were
constantly driven up and down the embankment.
But there was something that satisfied
the girl that at this spot a struggle had taken
place, for on the land side of the embankment
tufts of grass and clods of clay had been torn
out and thrown into the drove, and on the water
side hoof-marks and a slide in the greasy marl
were sealed up by the frost as evidences of a
horse having there gone down into the water.
These had not been observed by any one else, as
no one save Zita had known the exact place
where to look for them, and though distinguishable
enough when searched for, they were not
obtrusively manifest.</p>

<p>Zita had not merely a well-arranged mind,
but she was able to prize whatever facts came
before her at their true value.</p>

<p>Now, as she walked away from the river towards
Prickwillow, she realised that there was
strong presumptive evidence that Drownlands
had been engaged in a tussle with his enemy,
and that he knew how it was that Runham had
met his death, even if he were not absolutely
his murderer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>As Zita entered the house, she heard the
master's voice raised in tones of anger. He
was addressing Mrs. Tunkiss, the housekeeper.</p>

<p>'It's all idle excuse—you don't want the
trouble of it. I know your ways.'</p>

<p>'I haven't a needle will go through it,'
answered Leehanna.</p>

<p>Then Drownlands came out of the kitchen.
He was swinging in his hand the tiger-skin that
usually in cold or wet weather was slung over
his shoulders. His eye lighted on Zita, and his
face brightened at once.</p>

<p>'Look here, you Cheap Jack girl,' said he.
'The servants are idle curs, both of them. I
want Leehanna Tunkiss to mend my skin. I
have torn it. A few threads will suffice, and
she declares she has no needle that will go through
the leather. It's all idleness and excuse.'</p>

<p>'I will do it,' said Zita. 'We have all sizes
and sorts of needles in stock—for cobblers,
tailors, and all.'</p>

<p>She took the tiger-hide out of his hand.</p>

<p>'That's my great-coat—my mantle by day
and my rug and coverlet by night,' said Drownlands.
'I wear no other. We, who have been
born and bred in the Fens, folk are pleased to
call fen-tigers. That is why I got this skin.
Ten, fifteen years ago it was for sale in Ely, and
I bought it as a fancy, and have come to think
I can't do without it. Folks have got to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

know me now by it, and call me the Fen-tiger
King. Can you mend it?'</p>

<p>Turning the skin about, Zita said, 'It has
been given a wrench—tremenjous.'</p>

<p>'Well, so it has, and there is a rip as well.
If it is not drawn together now, it will go worse.
I don't want to wear rags, and I won't, that's
more—though Leehanna would have me, to
save trouble. It is easier to find an excuse than
to run threads with a needle.'</p>

<p>'I will do it,' said Zita. 'But you must suffer
me to take it to my room, that I may find a
suitable needle and stout thread.'</p>

<p>'Yes, take it,' said Drownlands, with his
beetling brows drawn together and his eyes
fixed on her from below them. 'Yes, Chestnut-hair!
you can do everything. In your store
you keep everything but excuses.'</p>

<p>'We could not sell them,' said Zita.</p>

<p>'And it is with excuses Leehanna serves me,'
he replied, and looked sideways angrily at his
housekeeper, who retreated muttering into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Then Drownlands went out, and Zita retired
to her room to accomplish the task she had
undertaken. As she turned the hide about, she
was struck with the evidence it gave of having
been wrenched and twisted with great strain of
violence. The wrench was no ordinary one,
produced by the catching of the skin in a nail
or door. The hide was in one place stretched

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>

out of shape by the force exerted on it; not
only so, but it had been contorted. Again, on
closer investigation, it appeared that some of
the hair had been ripped out by the roots, by
this means exposing the bare hide.</p>

<p>As Zita worked at the repair, her busy brain
occupied itself with the causes of this strain
and rent: how they could have been produced,
why the tension had been so excessive.</p>

<p>That Drownlands had not ridden to Ely on
the fair-day with his skin torn she was convinced
by his asking to have it mended now;
whereas, had it been in this condition before
fair-day, he would have required it to be repaired
before riding into Ely. Drownlands was
eccentric in his dress, but he was also punctilious
about its neatness. The injury done to the
tiger-skin must have been done since Tawdry
fair-day. All at once Zita dropped needle and
twine, started up, left her room, and went to
that which Drownlands used as his office, the
apartment into which he had conducted her
when he showed her his money.</p>

<p>Into the corner of this room he had flung the
flail that he had taken from her when she was
about to leave his farm and to return it to Mark
Runham; the flail she had picked up on the
bank was that Runham the elder had bought
from her for a guinea.</p>

<p>Zita knew that Drownlands was out, she had
seen him go to the stables across the yard.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>

He had not returned. She had not heard his
voice or step in the house since. Into the office
she was justified in penetrating, for the master
had asked her to keep it in order for him.
Leehanna Tunkiss neglected it, on the excuse
that she was afraid of disarranging his papers
and books. Zita knew that both flails were in
this room; that which Drownlands had bought
was suspended to a nail, the other was in the
corner where he had cast it.</p>

<p>Zita took both flails and examined them.
She saw that they had been subjected to rough
usage. The wood was bruised in both. It had
not been so when they left her hands in the
afternoon of Tawdry Fair. The flappers were
dinted, and there was a deep bruise in the
'handfast' of one. Both had been employed to
strike, and both had clashed against each other.</p>

<p>Zita replaced Drownlands' flail on the nail
whence she had unhitched it, and took a further
look at that which had belonged to Runham.</p>

<p>She now observed that the leather thongs
that attached the flapper to the handfast were
twisted, stretched, and strained, and that in the
twist was a tuft of hair precisely similar to that
of the tiger-skin.</p>

<p>She detached some of this hair, took it to her
room, and compared it with that still in place
on the hide. There could no longer be any
question but that a struggle had taken place
between the two men, that they had fought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

with the flails, that in course of the contest
the flail of Runham had become entangled in
the hide worn by Drownlands, and that the
flail had been twisted, and so had strained and
torn the skin.</p>

<p>In this case Drownlands most certainly knew
of the death of his adversary, and had had some
hand in it.</p>

<p>Zita knew enough, and she shuddered at the
thought that she was enjoying the hospitality
of a murderer.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">ON BONE RUNNERS</p>

<p class="p1">'HEIGH! Cheap Jack girl!'</p>

<p>Zita was out enjoying the crisp, frosty
air, on the frozen soil, sparkling under the
winter sun.</p>

<p>The November frost had continued, and
canals and rivers were iced over as well as
dykes and drains. God's plough was in the
soil—that is what country folk say when the
frost cuts deep into the earth. Where God's
plough has been, there golden harvests are
turned up to gladden all sorts and conditions
of men, and golden harvests turn to metallic
gold in the pockets of the farmers.</p>

<p>Every fen man, woman, and child can skate.
As soon as a child has found its legs, it essays
to slide, and when it can slide, it attempts to
skate. Fen skating is inelegant. Speed alone
is considered, and legs and arms fly about in
all directions. With scorn does the fen-man
contemplate the figuring of the fine gentleman
on the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>In winter, skating matches come as thick as
do football matches elsewhere. Parish is pitted
against parish, fen against fen, islet contests
with islet; even the frequenters of one tavern
are matched against the frequenters of another.</p>

<p>During a hard frost, locomotion for once
becomes easy and speedy in the Fens. Men
and women skate to market, children to school,
and smugglers run their goods from King's Lynn.</p>

<p>Zita had gone to the river side to see a sight
that was novel to her. As she stood watching
the skaters, Mark Runham came to the bank
side, his cheeks glowing, his fair hair blowing
about his ears, his eyes sparkling as though
frost crystals were in them.</p>

<p>'I say, Cheap Jack, get on your patines and
come.' Skates are termed <i>patines</i> in the Fens.</p>

<p>'If you mean skates, I have none. Besides,
I do not know how to use them.'</p>

<p>'Not got patines? Not know how to use
them? Then take a ride in my sleigh. I'll
run you along. Stay here a few minutes till
I have brought it.'</p>

<p>He was gone, flying down the river like a
swallow, and in ten minutes he had returned,
drawing after him a little sledge, and stayed
his course on the frozen surface of the Lark
before Zita.</p>

<p>'It's fine fun,' said he, with a voice cheery as
his smile. 'I'll run you where you like to go;
to Rossall Pits if you will—to Littleport—down

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

to the sea—up to Cambridge—to the end of the
world—anywhere you will.'</p>

<p>'Take me for a short distance only.'</p>

<p>'Then seat yourself in the sledge. We shall
go as the wind.'</p>

<p>Zita descended the bank to the ice.</p>

<p>'Look!' said he; 'do you see how my sleigh
is made? It is set on the leg-bones of a horse.
It runs on them in prime style. They wear as
steel, and slip along better.'</p>

<p>With her face radiant with happiness, Zita
placed herself in the little sleigh.</p>

<p>Then with a merry 'Whoop!' off he started
down the river. The wind rushed in Zita's face,
sharp and fresh, and drove the blood to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>They passed many 'patiners,' men and boys.
There were few women out. Later, when the
sun set, they would skate along the frozen
surface to the tavern. The tavern is an institution
in the Fens more frequented than elsewhere,
and frequented without scruple, not by men
only, but by women as well. There is a reason
for this. The fen-water is undrinkable. There
are no springs in the Fens. Those who live near
the rivers derive thence their tea water; river
water is potable and harmless when boiled, that
which is drawn from the peat is neither. Consequently
the inhabitants of the Fens are compelled
to drink something other than water,
and instinctively seek that something other at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>

the public-houses. When the woman's work-day
is over, she dons her patines and is off to
the 'Fish and Duck,' or the 'Spade and Becket,'
the 'Pike and Eel,' or the 'Sedge Sheaf,' to
moisten her dust-dry clay.</p>

<p>As Zita flew along the ice, she laughed for
joy of heart. Never had she travelled so fast.
Her wonted pace had been that of the snail,
for she had made progress in a heavily-laden
van, drawn by a depressed and stolid horse.
She was whirled past one of the main pumps
for throwing the water of the loads into the
river, and before she conceived it possible, she
had passed a second. And these engines, as
Mark told her, were two miles apart. Jewel's
fashion of travelling was very different from
that of Mark. Along the smoothest and most
level road he had been accustomed to crawl,
and then, after having made his pulses throb
and his sweat break out, to stand still, with
head down, to revive himself. Then nothing
would induce him to proceed till he considered
himself refreshed, when he would stumble on
for a couple of miles, and again pause. But
Mark flew along as though he would never
know exhaustion, and there was no bringing
him to a standstill.</p>

<p>After several vain attempts to arrest him,
Zita succeeded. He stood beside her sleigh
with a smile on his pleasant face, and with the
steam blowing from his nostrils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>'You must not go too far,' said Zita. 'We
have come a long way from Prickwillow.'</p>

<p>'What! are you tired? You have not been
dancing on sketches?'</p>

<p>'I do not understand your meaning.'</p>

<p>'Sketches?—does that word puzzle you as
did patines? They are what some folk call
stilts. I can run on them like a crane. But
sketches are cumbrous, and, when the fen is soft,
tire one speedily.'</p>

<p>'Let us return now.'</p>

<p>'No indeed. You have nothing to call you
back. That fellow Drownlands, old scoundrel,—I
beg your pardon,—will not be angry with
you and thrash you, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'He is not at home. He has gone abroad
for the day.'</p>

<p>'Then come along. We will visit Newport.'</p>

<p>'Please do not take me much farther.'</p>

<p>'Why not? Are you not enjoying the run?'</p>

<p>'I love it.'</p>

<p>'Then away we go. You are not afraid of
travelling, with me as your horse?'</p>

<p>She looked straight into his bright, honest
face, and laughed. 'No—you are too good for
any one to fear you.'</p>

<p>'How do you know that?'</p>

<p>'You carry honesty in your eyes, and "good
boy" written across your brow.'</p>

<p>'It is time for me to run,' laughed Mark, 'or
my head will be turned.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>He buckled himself to his task, pranced from
side to side, swinging the little sleigh to right
and left, in his light-hearted frolic, and then
away he went, running the sleigh with Zita in
it straight along the canal.</p>

<p>The flatness, the monotony of the Fens, the
absence of unshackled nature, the treelessness
of the region, the lack of everything that can
arrest the changing lights and passing shadows,
combine to make the district one to send a chill
into the mind of the visitor. Flat as the sea,
it is devoid of its diversity of tint and tumultuous
or glassy beauty. Nevertheless, the fen
exercises a charm over the mind and holds with
a spell the heart of the native. He can live
nowhere else. He will not emigrate. He feels
bound to spend all his days in the fen. Only
when the vital spark expires does his body
leave the turf to repose in the clay of the islet
graveyards. That the farmer and landowner
should love the fen is not marvellous, because
of the richness of the soil and the profits they
make out of it; but why the labourer should
cling to the spongy turf is not so explicable.
He may be discontented, and be a grumbler,
but he is discontented with his lot, and envies
the taverner or the smuggler on the Fens,
grumbles at the hardness of his work or the
lowness of his pay; but he is not discontented
because the fen is so flat, and he has no word
against its hideousness, or, at least, its uniformity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>One reason why the labourer in the Fens does
not think of leaving it may be that he uses tools
there different from those employed elsewhere,
and he would have to learn his trade anew,
employ unfamiliar tools, and be subjected to
ridicule when handling them awkwardly. It is
strange, but true, that those men are more
naturally prone to leave their homes who
inhabit mountainous lands than such as dwell
in level districts.</p>

<p>How far was Mark going? How Zita flashed
past the windmills, some of which had their
sails in motion! A little rising ground showed,
with some trees clustered on it—that must be
Littleport.</p>

<p>'Mark,' said Zita suddenly, 'I want to ask
you a question.'</p>

<p>'Say on,' said he, and relaxed the speed at
which he was spinning her along, and finally
came to a standstill. How pretty she was, with
her glowing cheeks, her cherry lips, the light of
the winter sun in her soft hazel eyes and in her
rich, burnished, chestnut hair! How pretty
that hair was now, in some confusion, puffed
out of its order, the coppery strands on her brow,
one down her cheek! The wildness of her
appearance thus untidied by the wind made
her more than ever charming.</p>

<p>Mark looked with eyes that could not be
satiated with looking.</p>

<p>But it was not merely her beauty that struck

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

him. It was the exuberant happiness that
seemed to be bursting forth at her eyes, running
out of her little head in every shining hair,
glowing in those bright-tinted cheeks, burning
in those carnation-red lips.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear little Zita, what is it?'</p>

<p>'Mark, it is something I have thought about
and have puzzled over. It seems strange to
speak about it now—now when I am so joyous—and
it is connected with things so sad to me
and to you.'</p>

<p>'But what is it, little rogue?'</p>

<p>'Mark, that terrible night when your father
and mine died'—. She paused.</p>

<p>'Well, Zita?'</p>

<p>'Then—before his death, I mean—before the
death of my own dear daddy, and I can't say
whether it was before or after yours was drowned—I
heard such a strange, such an awful sound.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'In the sky—above; like the barking of dogs.
It was just as though a hunter was going by
with his pack. Shall I tell you what I thought
it? It was just as if the dogs had smelt the
fox, and gave tongue. Was it not dreadful?
I could see nothing; I could hear—that was
all.'</p>

<p>'I think nothing of that,' said Mark. 'I know
our fen-folk say it is the devils running after a
human soul. They have snuffed it from the
bottomless pit, then the Great Hunter of Souls

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

opens the kennel door, and out they burst,
yelping, snapping, panting, and come after it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Mark!'</p>

<p>'But if the soul be very nimble, it runs before
them, runs on the wind, swift as an arrow, and
slips in at heaven's gate, and then the evil spirits
yelp and bay and bark outside. But it is all
fudge and nonsense. I believe that the sound
comes from the wild geese.'</p>

<p>'I shall ever think of this. Oh, I hope I shall
never hear that dreadful sound again. My dear
father—no—he would certainly escape those
hounds. They would never catch him. For
him the Golden Gate would be opened, and the
dogs be shut outside. He was so gentle, so
kind, so true. Oh, I loved him so—so much!'
And thereupon the brightness was gone out of
the sunny little face, and it was bathed in tears.</p>

<p>'Put all this aside. Think no more of it.'</p>

<p>'They were in full pursuit when I heard
them.'</p>

<p>'The geese? And you are a little goose if
you think more of this.'</p>

<p>'Mark, may I never hear that sound again!'</p>

<p>'Or, if you do, Zita, may I be near you to
laugh your fears away. No, not laugh—kiss
them away, as I do now.'</p>

<p>'Mark! you <em>are</em> a naughty boy! I did not
think it of you.'</p>

<p>The roses had come back, and the glow was
returned, and in one cheek deeper than the other.</p>

<p class="center">PIP BEAMISH</p>

<p class="p1">'DO go on and leave me alone,' said Zita.</p>

<p>Then again the young man sped forward
with the sledge, at full speed on his skates.
There was a glow of something more than health—something
more than the reaction produced
by the fresh wind—in his cheeks.</p>

<p>'Here's a joke!' exclaimed Mark, stopping
for a moment. 'I see quite a throng round
Beamish's mill.'</p>

<p>Again he went on. And Zita, looking in the
direction he had indicated, saw that a considerable
number of persons was collected, some on
the banks, some on the ice, and as many as
could be accommodated on the brick platform
of a windmill.</p>

<p>Without halting, Mark said, 'The paddle
can't go because of the frost, but Pip Beamish's
tongue can wag, and when it wags it is for
mischief. He is a restless, dissatisfied rascal.
We'll go and hear what he has to say.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark stayed the sledge when he reached the
outer ring of the congregation that was gathered
together about the mill.</p>

<p>The day was Sunday, so no work was being
done. There were idlers everywhere, specially
on the ice. In present days there is little
church-going in the Fens, in former days there
was none. Churches are few and far apart.
In mediæval times the monks of Ely had
chapels on every islet that rose a few feet
above the meres, and they boated from one
to another, gathering around them for divine
service and moral instruction the aquatic population
of the Fens. With the Reformation these
chapels were let fall into ruin, and care for the
souls of the fen-dwellers ceased. The canons
of the cathedral were wealthy and idle, and it
never so much as occurred to their sleepy,
stagnant consciences that they had duties to
perform towards the inhabitants of the district
whence they drew their revenues.</p>

<p>When the meres were dried, and settlers
occupied the drained land, then the parochial
clergy were unable to cope with the altered
condition of affairs. The roads were impassable,
the distances enormous, their incomes had
not increased with the alteration in the value
of the lands included in their vast parishes.
Consequently, the fen-folk came to think little
of their religious duties. The church towers
might serve as landmarks, but the church

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>

pastors were not spiritual guides. The only
form of religion that commended itself to an
amphibious population was Anabaptism, and
that mainly because it consisted of a good
souse in fen-water. A few of the sterner spirits
settled into the sect, but the bulk of the natives
grew up and lived without any religion at all;
or, if they professed to be Christians, they took
care to allow it in no way to interfere with their
profits or their pleasures.</p>

<p>The assemblage about the mill consisted of
labouring men and their wives; some were in
their Sunday clothes, but others had not taken
the trouble to 'clean' themselves. Such were
the men who lounged about on holidays with
springes and nets in their pockets, and a gun
barrel up the left sleeve.</p>

<p>A stool was planted close to the mill, and on
it stood a young man with high cheek-bones,
long dark hair, and glittering eyes under heavy,
bushy brows. He had unusually lengthy arms,
and at the extremities of the arms unusually
broad, flat hands. These he flourished about.
He drew in his elbows to his sides, and emphasised
an appeal by suddenly throwing out
his arms and extending his fingers. Having his
back to the mill, which was constructed of boards,
what he said was audible to some distance.
The boards served as reverberators.</p>

<p>'I say it is a sin,' shouted the orator. 'Here
be the farmers turning earth into corn, and corn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>

into gold guineas, and the men as helps them
to do it ain't paid enough to keep body and
soul together. What was wheat a quarter only
a short while ago? It was one hundred and
twenty shillings and sixpence. Now it is
ninety-six shillings. And what are the wages?
Seven to ten shillings. What is the difference
between seven shillings and ninety-six?
Eighty-nine, is it not? That is what goes into
the farmers' pockets. Who do all the work?
And who get all the gains? Look into every
stackyard and see what wheat is there for the
rats and mice to eat,—they are not begrudged
it, let them eat,—but you and your children
must starve. Why are not the stacks threshed
out? Because the farmers are waiting till the
wheat goes up to one hundred and twenty-six
shillings again. You may perish of hunger—that
is nothing to them. Your children may
run naked—that is nothing to them. You may
drink fen-water because you haven't twopence
to pay for a half-pint of beer—that is nothing
to them. You mayn't have a blanket to throw
over your beds this freezing weather—they don't
care. You may have the walls of your cots so
full of cracks that the wind whistles through
them—they don't care. Your hands have held
the plough, your hands have sown the corn,
your wives and children have hoed it three
times, you have reaped it, you have stacked it—and
there it stands for rats and mice to eat,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>

till prices go up to one hundred and twenty-six
shillings. Ninety-six is not good enough for
them,—these bloodsuckers,—and you are content
to let things remain so. What I maintain is,
that you have a right to say to the farmers,
"Thresh out now while we are hungry; the
price is too high even now for us, and why
should sad days for us be golden days for
you?"'</p>

<p>His address was received with applause.</p>

<p>Mark turned to Zita and said in a low tone,
'He is right after a fashion. I'll set to work
and thresh to-morrow. I'll let the labourers
who are on my farm have this corn ten per cent.
under market price. I cannot act fairer than
that.'</p>

<p>'And how is it with the millers?' pursued the
orator. 'Don't they take toll of every sack of
corn you send to them to be ground? Are not
their pigs and cows kept fat on what the miller's
fist brings up out of your flour? As if it were
not enough that you were cheated by the farmer,
you must be cheated also by the miller. Pillaged
in every way, pinched on every side,
trodden on by every one—that is your fate.'</p>

<p>His words met with applause.</p>

<p>'We have gone on hoping, and we have been
disappointed. What good comes to us from
Parliament? None at all. What help do we
get from the laws? The laws are made for the
benefit of the farmer, and not for the poor man.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

What good to us are magistrates—justices of
the peace? They are appointed to hold us
down, to fine and imprison us. They are the
farmer's friends, not the friends of the poor
man. We are told that Old Boney is the foe
of our country. Men are called from the
plough, plucked away from their wives and
children, to serve the king against this Bonaparte.
What does patriotism mean? It means
loving the country where we are ill-treated and
starved, loving the king who never concerns
himself about us, loving the laws that oppress
us, loving the magistrates who imprison us,
loving the farmers who are sucking the marrow
out of our bones. I'm no patriot. As well ask
a poor prisoner to love his jail, shed his blood
in its defence. I'll tell you what it is, friends,
Heaven helps them who help themselves. No
good will come to us from waiting. Heaven is
silent so long as we bear and do nothing, but
Heaven will send its lightning and hailstones
when we take the matter into our own hands.
It was so in the day of battle in Gibeon; then
the Lord cast down great stones from heaven
upon the oppressors of Israel, and made sun
and moon to stand still till they were cut to
pieces, smitten hip and thigh. The great stones
would have remained in the clouds, sun and
moon have taken their usual courses, had not
Joshua and Israel armed themselves to fight—to
right their own wrongs. So will it be again,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

so has it ever been, so will it be unto the end.
We must raise our hands to fight our fight, raise
our hands against our oppressors, or there will
be no help for us from on high. If you remain
hoping and doing nothing, then, as I said before—to
be trampled into the mud—that is your
fate.'</p>

<p>'And to be thrashed and to be kicked out of
employ—that is what is laid up for you, you
rascal!' shouted an imperious voice.</p>

<p>Zita and Mark looked round, and saw behind
them Drownlands on his horse.</p>

<p>'I will see to you, Pip Beamish, as sure as
that I am a Commissioner,' continued the master
of Prickwillow. 'You were not set to tend a
mill that you might stump it and foment ill-feeling.
I shall report what you have said at
the next meeting of the Commissioners, and
shall have you cast adrift.' Then, turning to
the audience, Drownlands brandished his whip
and cried, 'As for the rest of you, disperse
instantly, or I will ride up and down among
you and lash you with my whip, and send you
skipping home.'</p>

<p>The crowd broke up into knots, then further
dissolved and dispersed.</p>

<p>'I'll have your names, and see that you are
thrown out of employ. Get home at once,
before the whip is at your breech.'</p>

<p>The haughty, commanding tone of the man,
and the knowledge that he was one ready to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

execute his threats, seemed to make those
who hesitated consider that the better part of
valour was discretion, and they scattered in all
directions.</p>

<p>Drownlands, upright in his stirrups, looked
about him, marking those who seemed reluctant
to obey his orders. Then his eye rested on
Zita. His face changed immediately.</p>

<p>'You here?'</p>

<p>'Mark ran me up in his sleigh.'</p>

<p>'Mark? Mark? What Mark? How dare
you come here without leave from me?'</p>

<p>'I am not your servant. I am not your
prisoner. I go where I choose. I do what I
will,' answered Zita, nettled at his tone.</p>

<p>'Hallo!' scoffed Drownlands. 'What! has
the mad folly of Ephraim Beamish infected your
little brain?'</p>

<p>'My brain is sound enough. It is you, Master
Drownlands, who forget what your place is, and
what is mine. You are not my master. I am
not your servant. I pay my way. I am a lodger
at Prickwillow, nothing more. If I please to go
out for a run on the ice with Mark, I am not idle.
I have done my work in your house, and may
enjoy myself as I like.'</p>

<p>'Do not bandy words with me.'</p>

<p>'It is of no use arguing with him,' whispered the
young yeoman. 'He is in one of his passions,
when he acts and talks unreasonably. Take no
notice of him.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>'What are you whispering about? Making
mock of me?' roared Drownlands.</p>

<p>'Come, Cheap Jack,' said Mark, 'jump on to
the sleigh again; and you, Master Drownlands,'
he looked at the horseman with a laugh, 'let us
race—you on the bank, I on the canal—and Zita
the prize.'</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ON ONE FOOTING</p>

<p class="p1">ZITA was back at Prickwillow long before
the master.</p>

<p>She anticipated a scene with him and prepared
for it. He was wont to domineer in his house
and on the farm, and she had just seen how
he domineered and enforced his will on an
assemblage of men not under subjection to him.</p>

<p>She was sensible that he had gradually
assumed towards herself an air of authority, but
he had not hitherto addressed her in a dictatorial
tone so distinct as to provoke resistance. She
had, however, perceived that the time was
approaching when some understanding must be
reached as to her position and their mutual
relations. She was not a domestic in the house,
to be ordered about or to have her liberty curtailed.
She had accepted his hospitality, not
entered into his service.</p>

<p>Zita was alive to the fact that every one in
the house and on the farm—Mrs. Tunkiss, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>

shaking maid-of-all-work, the herd, the labourers,
the stable-boy—all stood in awe of him. The
housekeeper was as a lamb under his reprimand;
a word addressed to the girl with St. Vitus'
dance drove her into convulsions; an order given
to the men galvanised them into momentary
agility and sent the boy skipping like a flea.
Zita despised them for their subserviency. She
was not afraid of Drownlands. She knew that
concerning him which was sufficient to make
him quake before her.</p>

<p>Zita had been accustomed to face men of every
description. Her father had stood between her
and coarse insult, but she had been obliged to
confront men rude, boisterous, and disposed to
take advantage of her weakness, and had acquired
readiness in dealing with them, and nerve not to
show timidity.</p>

<p>When she had seen the cringe and cower
of those whom Drownlands had threatened, she
tossed her chestnut gold head in a manner expressive
of impatience.</p>

<p>Drownlands had noticed this, and Zita had
seen in his darkening brow that he had observed,
was surprised and offended at the contemptuous
action. The moment was not far off when he
would test his strength against hers.</p>

<p>'The sooner the better,' said Zita to herself;
and, instead of avoiding him, she went across the
yard to meet him as he rode up the drove. She
took his horse by the bridle and said, 'I will

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

lead him to the stable; the men are at chapel or
the beerhouse, and the boy is with the cows.'</p>

<p>'You won't curry favour by doing this,' said
Drownlands.</p>

<p>'Curry favour? I curry nothing. Currycomb
your horse yourself!'</p>

<p>'I want a word with you, Cheap Jack.'</p>

<p>'And I with you, Fen-tiger—we must settle
terms.'</p>

<p>'Terms? What terms?'</p>

<p>'The price of my lodging.'</p>

<p>'I do not understand you.'</p>

<p>'I have a capital copper warming-pan,' said
Zita, 'with George and the Dragon on the lid.
A stunner. I've reckoned up what meat I've
ate, and all I've drunk, and the wear and tear of
knives, linen, dishes, and so forth, and I think
the copper warming-pan will cover it all.'</p>

<p>Drownlands had flung himself from his horse.</p>

<p>He stared at Zita; he did not in the least
seize her meaning.</p>

<p>'If you don't care for a warming-pan,' she said,
'then there's half a dozen red plush weskits, with
gilded buttons and dogs' heads on 'em—you
can't wear all six, but take your choice and I'll
make up with scrubbing-brushes, starch, and blue.
I think the tiger-skin and a red weskit under it,
and them bushy eyebrows tied in a knot as they
be now, will make such a figure of you as will
drive babies and girls into fits.'</p>

<p>'You are mocking me! You dare to do that?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>'I'm not mocking you, though I don't say I'm
not inclined to whisk a red weskit before you,
when you stamp and blare like a bull—for fun,
you know. I love fun, but I am not mocking
you. I am too much obliged to you for receiving
me to do that.'</p>

<p>'I will turn you out—you and your van—into
the winter frost.'</p>

<p>'When? To-morrow? I am ready to go.'</p>

<p>'You shall not go!' exclaimed Drownlands,
coming round the head of the horse to her and
seizing her wrist. 'You shall not go; I know
why you want to leave me. I know whither
you want to go.'</p>

<p>'Whither?'</p>

<p>'To Crumbland.'</p>

<p>'I have not been invited there; but if you
turn me out, I shall find a shakedown somewhere.
There is that girl Kenappuch at the mill. She'll
have me for certain, and I'll pay her; not so
high as a warming-pan, but in currants and figs
and a roll of calico. The accommodation won't
be so good as yours, nor the feeding so liberal.'</p>

<p>'You have got to know her also?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And Mark Runham?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he has got to know me. That's the
way to put it.'</p>

<p>'You are resolved to seek friends where I
disapprove—among those who are my enemies?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing and care less about your

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>

quarrels. I've got acquainted with both, and
they are the only persons in the Fens for whom
I care'—</p>

<p>'Oh, you care only for them.'</p>

<p>'Outside Prickwillow. You cut me short
before I had finished my sentence. That is
bad manners. If we kept manners in stock, I'd
sell you a penn'orth.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said Drownlands, for a moment relaxing
his iron grasp, 'you allow me some of your
regard?'</p>

<p>'I always care for every one who is kind to me,
and you have been kind to both me and my poor
father.' At the mention of her father Zita's lips
and voice quivered, and tears filled her eyes.
'You were good to him. I do not forget that,
and I'll pay you for it in anything I have got
that you fancy. What do you say to smoked
mother-of-pearl buttons?'</p>

<p>'Will you be quiet?' roared Drownlands,
with an oath.</p>

<p>'Or,' continued Zita, 'there are several pounds
of strong fish-glue. It went soft and got mouldy
in the van, but I got it dry in the kitchen and
wiped the mould off. It is all right now; the
strength isn't taken out of it. A shilling a
pound is what it would cost you in Ely, but
as I offer it to you, I'll knock off twopence.
You shall have it for tenpence per pound—so
you see I do care for you, twopence in the
shilling.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Drownlands' face darkened; he pressed the
girl's wrist so that she uttered an exclamation
of pain.</p>

<p>'You hurt me,' she said; 'that's something off
your account.'</p>

<p>'You are making a jest of me!' gasped the
man. 'And you dare to do so? You are not
afraid?'</p>

<p>'What should I be afraid of?'</p>

<p>'I can hurt you—worse than by nipping your
wrist.'</p>

<p>'And I can defend myself,' she answered. '<em>I</em>
afraid of <em>you</em>? No; it was you who trembled
and screamed like a woman when I touched you
on the river bank that night we first met. It is
<em>you</em> who have reason to be afraid of <em>me</em>.'</p>

<p>The colour went out of his face.</p>

<p>'No, I am not afraid of you,' continued Zita.
'I remember how, when you sought to ride on,
I stopped your way, and drove you where I
wanted you to go—drove you with the flail.'</p>

<p>He released her arm. She felt that his hand
was shaking. He knew that it shook, and he
was afraid lest she should observe it.</p>

<p>He walked in silence to the stable with his
head lowered. Zita followed. She had gained
a first advantage. She had forestalled his attack,
and now, instead of her being cowed by him, he
was subdued by her.</p>

<p>When they were both in the stable,—for she
had followed him to show him how little fear

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>

she entertained,—then he addressed her in an
altered tone.</p>

<p>'You do not intend to leave me?'</p>

<p>'No; if you desire me to remain, I will
remain.'</p>

<p>'I do desire it. I could not endure that you
should go.'</p>

<p>'That is right; but why did you threaten me?
I will stay. I could not put up old Jewel in
the windmill, and I haven't been invited to
Crumbland by Mark Runham.'</p>

<p>He stamped his foot impatiently and set his
teeth.</p>

<p>'Why do you speak of him again?'</p>

<p>'Speech is free here—in the van—in a king's
palace—everywhere save a gaol. I will speak of
any one I choose, at any time, before any one,
and in any place I like.'</p>

<p>'Why did you go with him today?'</p>

<p>'Because I am free to go where I choose, and
with whom I choose. This is Sunday, and a
holiday.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but if you have any regard for me, do
not go with him at all.' He drew a long breath,
removed and put on again his broad-brimmed
hat. 'Why do you speak to me of payment for
the trifling things I have done for you? of
payment with warming-pans, red waistcoats, and
fish-glue?'</p>

<p>'I am glad we are round to that point again,'
said Zita, 'for speak of that I must. No one can

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

be expected to do things for nothing. If you
house me and Jewel, and feed us both'—</p>

<p>'You have worked—you have done more than
that beldame Leehanna and the girl would do
in twenty years.'</p>

<p>'I have taken that into account. I know how
many hours I have worked at fivepence three-farthings
(needles and thread included). Nevertheless,
the balance is against me. There is the
warming-pan, or the scrubbing-brushes, or the
fish-glue'—</p>

<p>He struck his fist against the stable door to
drown her words.</p>

<p>Zita put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>'It is of no good your acting the fool,' she
said. 'What is right is right. I shouldn't feel
square in my insides if the account were not
balanced. My dear father was mighty particular
on that score. Every night we balanced our
accounts as true as any banker, with a stump of
a pencil as he sucked. If I don't balance I can't
sleep. I'll put to my account some pins I had
set to yours, all because of that squinch of the
wrist you gave me. If I were to leave your
house to-morrow, Master Drownlands, you'd
find on the shelf in my room a row of articles
that I reckoned up would belong in rights to
you as balancing our account.'</p>

<p>He did not answer. He thrust his horse into
a stall and put a halter round its head.</p>

<p>Then Zita went to the corn-chest and brought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>

out a feed. The horse whinnied as he sniffed
the oats. Drownlands was in the stall tightening
the knot at the end of the halter. As Zita
turned to depart, after having tossed the oats
into the manger, he came out after her, and,
laying hold of one side of the corn-measure,
said—</p>

<p>'Are you going?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I have fed Pepper.'</p>

<p>He shook the measure, and said, in tones of
angry discouragement, 'You will not take a bite
of my bread, nor lie on a flock of my wool, nor
cover your golden head with one tile of my roof,
but you must weigh each and prize and pay me
its value to the turn of a hair.'</p>

<p>'Not so exactly; of course, I leave a margin.'</p>

<p>'A margin of what?'</p>

<p>'Profits!'</p>

<p>'To whom?'</p>

<p>'To myself, of course. We should never get
along in the world without profits. When we
come to deal among friends, as you and I, then
the profits are reasonable. But when one has to
do with the general public,—that father always
called the General Jackass,—then you lay it on
thick and heavy. Without profits of some sort
one can't sleep the sleep of innocence, as father
said. But it is one thing dealing with General
Jackass and another with a friend; and I want
you to understand the footing on which we deal
is the latter.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>'So—the footing of buy and sell?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I take my small profits. When a
dressmaker makes your frocks, she charges you
for a packet of needles and uses one—the rest
are profits. She charges you for a knot of tape,
and uses two yards and a half—the rest is
profit. And she cuts out eight yards of lining,
and puts down twelve—four are profits; and she
puts you some frilling round your neck and
cuffs, charging three yards, and she uses one—there's
profits again. I do the same with you.
I couldn't sleep if I didn't. It's feather bed and
pillow and bolster to me—profits.'</p>

<p>'Take what you will. All you like.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Zita. 'Fair trade between us. We
deal as friends. I respect and regard you too
greatly to treat you as if you were General
Jackass.'</p>

<p>Then she left the empty corn-measure in his
hand and walked away, with a swing of the
shoulders, a toss of the head, an elasticity in her
tread, that appertained to one who was victor—not
to one defeated. And Drownlands stood
looking after her, holding the empty corn-measure,
and he wondered at himself that he
had been beaten at every point by this girl—he
who had galloped home boiling with anger,
resolved to break her into meek subjection to
his will.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ON ANOTHER FOOTING</p>

<p class="p1">A SOUGH of wind passed over the Fens
like a long-drawn sigh. Every one who
heard it listened in silence. It was repeated,
and then the general comment was, 'The skating
is over.'</p>

<p>Nor was the comment falsified by the event.
The wind had veered round suddenly, without
warning, to the south-west. It blew all night
and sent a warm rain against the windows that
faced that quarter. It covered wood and walls
with dew. The ice broke up in the river, it dissolved
in the dykes. The sails of the mills were
again in revolution, they whirled merrily, merrily.</p>

<p>Zita had come upon the embankment to see
the broken ice drift down the sluggish river,
swept along by the wind rather than the current.
There she encountered Mark Runham.</p>

<p>'What, you here, Cheap Jackie? No, hang it!
I won't call you that. It seems impudent; but
I do not mean that, you may be sure.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>'I know that, and am not offended.'</p>

<p>'Your name—it continually slips my memory.'</p>

<p>'Zita.'</p>

<p>'A queer sort of a name that.'</p>

<p>'It is not often you meet a Cheap Jack girl.
They do not come thick as windmills in the
flats. So it suits me to bear a queer name.'</p>

<p>'A queer name becomes a queer girl.'</p>

<p>'Thanks. I have something for you—half a
pound of bird's eye.'</p>

<p>'What for?'</p>

<p>'In payment for my run on the ice.'</p>

<p>'I do not want payment.'</p>

<p>'It gave you trouble, made you hot, but it was
a very great pleasure to me.'</p>

<p>'I won't take it.' The young fellow laughed
with his merry eyes as well as with his fresh
lips. 'Can you understand this, that it gave me
five times as much pleasure as it did you to spin
you along and see the red roses bloom in your
cheeks and those dark eyes of yours twinkle as
though there were Jack o' Lanterns dancing in
them? Zita, it is not every day that a lad gets
the chance of running a pretty girl along the
ice. It is I am in debt to you. We'll square
the account, anyhow.' He caught her head
between his hands and gave her a kiss on her
red lips. 'There is the account scored out, and
a new account begun.'</p>

<p>'That is not fair!' exclaimed Zita, shrinking
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>'What! not settled? Again, then.' He
kissed her once more. 'And so—till all is right,
and the balance squared.'</p>

<p>Then he laughed, and, releasing her head,
said—</p>

<p>'You know we raced,—that old Drownlands
and I,—and you were to be the prize. I won
you.' Then, seeing that she looked disturbed,
he went off to, 'Now, Cheap Jackie, tell me, was
not that a droll sort of a life, going over the
world in that comical van?'</p>

<p>'It was a very happy life, and the van was not
comical at all. It is splendid.'</p>

<p>'I have not seen it.'</p>

<p>'Then why did you call it unsuitable names?'</p>

<p>'A jolly life, was it?'</p>

<p>'Indeed it was. I was very happy in it—specially
when we had piled up the profits.'</p>

<p>'You made a pile when you sold my father a
flail for a guinea.'</p>

<p>'We did; but if it is any satisfaction to you
to know it, it was the thoughts of that made
him pass away so happy.'</p>

<p>'A guinea was nought to my father; he was
rich. Now I am rich.' Then, with a trip of his
foot on the bank as though he were dancing,
'Zita, what a joke it would be for us to go round
in the summer with the old van and the stock-in-trade.
What have you done with the goods?'</p>

<p>'They are safe.'</p>

<p>'And we will visit Swaffham, and Littleport,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>

and Ely together, and sell away like blazes.
I'll attend to the horse, and you shall do all the
talking the folk want. What fun it will be!'</p>

<p>'No,' said Zita, colouring; 'that will not be
right.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'No. It was all very well with my father.
But I will not go again.'</p>

<p>'You must—you shall—with me!'</p>

<p>'I will not—indeed I will not.' She turned
away.</p>

<p>'Well, anyhow you will show me the van?'</p>

<p>'Yes. When you like.'</p>

<p>'I can't well go into Prickwillow as matters
are between us and Drownlands—not that I
bear him ill-will, but he is sour as a crab towards
me. We will manage it somehow at some time.
But I can't help thinking what fun it would be
for us two to travel the world all over together,
selling pots and pans. I wish I had been born
a Cheap Jack. Where are you off to now, Zita?'</p>

<p>'I am going to see Kainie at Red Wings.'</p>

<p>'I will go with you. I also want to see her.
I am very fond of Kainie, I am.' Said with a
mischievous laugh.</p>

<p>'I daresay you are, but I am going alone.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense! I shall go with you. I must see
Kainie. I have an errand to her.'</p>

<p>'Who sent you?'</p>

<p>Mark hesitated, then said, 'Well, no one.
But it is business. I must go.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>'Then go. I will remain here.'</p>

<p>Zita observed a lighter moored to the bank
in the river. She stepped towards it. 'I will
go into the barge. Will you come with me and
punt me about?'</p>

<p>'I cannot. I must go to Kainie.'</p>

<p>'You wanted to come with me in the van,
asked me to go with you. Now I ask you to
come with me in the boat, and you will not.'</p>

<p>'I pay you off,' said Mark good-naturedly.
'You would not travel with me in the van, so
I will not travel with you in the barge. But,
seriously, I cannot. I must go on to Kainie.
Come along with me,' urged Mark. 'Kainie
will be pleased to see you.'</p>

<p>'Oh! you can answer for her?'</p>

<p>'In some things; certainly in this.'</p>

<p>'I will not go.'</p>

<p>Zita pouted and turned her back on Mark.
The young man did not press her to change her
intention. The decision in her face, the look in
her eyes, convinced him that his labour would
be in vain were he to attempt it. He started in
the direction of Red Wings without her, and
whistled as he walked. Zita's brow was moody.
She was a girl of impulse and of no self-restraint,
changeful in temper and vehement in passion.</p>

<p>There was no reason why she should resent
Mark's going to Red Wings, and yet she did
resent it. If he had to go, and she refused to
accompany him, he must go without her. That

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

was obvious, and yet she was very wroth. In
her mind she contrasted Drownlands with Mark.
She had but to express a wish to the former,
and it was complied with. Had she said to him
that she desired him to row her on the canal, he
would have placed himself at her service with
eager delight. But this scatterbrained Mark
had no notion of submission to her wishes.
He had desired her society on the bank;
when she refused it, he did without it, and did
without it with a light heart—he went away
whistling.</p>

<p>Zita stepped into the barge and seated herself
on the side. She put her chin in her hand and
looked sullenly into the water full of broken,
half-dissolved pieces of ice.</p>

<p>She was hot, her angry blood was racing
through her veins. She was, in her way, as impetuous
as Drownlands. She had been suffered
in her girlhood by her father to follow her own
bent, to do just what she liked. But, indeed,
there had been no occasion for him to cross her,
their interests were identical. Good-natured
though Zita was, she was masterful. She had
sense, but sense is sometimes obscured by
passion.</p>

<p>She sat biting her nails. A fire was in her
cheeks, and now and then the tears forced themselves
into her burning eyes.</p>

<p>What could Mark have to call him to Red
Wings?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>What possible business could he have with
Kainie?</p>

<p>Red Wings was not on his land; the mill did
not drain his dykes.</p>

<p>Zita marvelled how long Mark would remain
with Kerenhappuch. Would he sit down with
her in her cabin? Would their conversation
turn on herself—Zita? Would Mark say that
she was sulky? What would Kerenhappuch
reply? Would she not say, 'What else can you
expect from a girl who is a vagabond? We
who lead settled lives in mills and farmhouses
know how to behave ourselves. What can you
get out of a chimney but soot? What does a
marsh breed but gadflies?'</p>

<p>It is really wonderful what a cloud of torments
an ingenious mind can rouse if it resolves to give
run to fancy. Perhaps a woman is more prone
to this than a man. She conceives conversations
relative to herself; she puts into the mouths
of the speakers the most offensive expressions
relative to herself. She wreathes their faces with
contemptuous smiles, gives to their voices insulting
intonations, and finally assumes that all the
brood of her festering brain is real fact, and not
mirage.</p>

<p>It was so now with Zita.</p>

<p>She was startled from her reverie of self-torment
by a shock in the boat. She looked up,
startled, and saw before her a man with long
arms and large hands, dark-haired and dark-eyed.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>

He was handsome, but his face bore an
expression of sour discontent. The thin lips
were indicative of a sharp and querulous temper,
and the checks seemed as though they could not
dimple into laughter.</p>

<p>'What are you doing in the lighter?' asked
the man, whom Zita recognised as Ephraim
Beamish, the orator.</p>

<p>'I suppose I have as much right to be in the
boat as you,' answered the girl peevishly.</p>

<p>'No doubt. We neither have any right anywhere.
We are both poor. I know who you
are—the Cheap Jack girl. I hear you have
been taken into Prickwillow. Wish you happiness.
It is not the place I should care to be in.
Drownlands is not the man to clothe the poor,
house the wanderer, feed the hungry, without
expecting his reward—and that here. He does
nothing of good to any one but to serve his own
ends. He has just had me turned out.'</p>

<p>'Turned out of what?'</p>

<p>'Turned out of my mill, out of my employ,
out of my livelihood. I have now to run about
the fens, in ice and snow. I have no home. I
am a gentleman, however, for I have no work.
The rats may shelter in the barn, the mice may
nest in the stack, but I must be without a roof
to cover my head, without work to engage my
hands, and without bread to put into my mouth.
And all for why? Because I have been bold
to speak the truth. Truth is like light. Men

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>

hate it and turn their eyes from it. Them as
speaks the truth gets persecuted, and I am one
of these.'</p>

<p>'You can obtain work elsewhere,' said Zita,
displeased at having her imaginary troubles
broken in on by some one with a real grievance.</p>

<p>'No, I cannot,' answered Beamish; 'the owners
of property hang together like bees when they
swarm. If you disturb one, the whole hive sets
on you and stings you to death.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Zita irritably, 'you need not tell
me all this. I cannot assist you.'</p>

<p>'I do not suppose you can. But—has
Property got into your blood, that you speak so
sharp to me? Maybe, like a bat, you're hanging
on to it by a claw. Like a gnat, you have your
lips to it, and are sucking your fill. I do not
ask your help. I fend for myself. But I like
to talk. Nothing will be done to correct evils
if the evils be not talked about. You must go
round Jericho and blow the trumpets seven
times, and seven times again, before the walls
will fall, and we can march up and take the city.
Let Property look out. The working people
will not stand to be robbed and maltreated any
longer.'</p>

<p>Beamish unloosed the rope that attached the
boat to the shore, and, taking a pole, thrust out
and began slowly to force the vessel up stream,
talking as he punted.</p>

<p>'You may tell Drownlands my curse rests on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

him; and that will rot his timber and rust his
corn.'</p>

<p>'I will bear him no such message,' said Zita.
'But where are you taking me?'</p>

<p>'Up the river. I shall leave you presently;
but I will return and punt you back again.'</p>

<p>'Where are you going?'</p>

<p>'To Red Wings.'</p>

<p>'What do you want there?'</p>

<p>'I have an errand,' answered Beamish.</p>

<p>'There is one gone there before you, with an
errand from himself—and that is Mark Runham.'</p>

<p>'He there!' exclaimed Pip Beamish, leaning
on the punting-pole and looking down into the
water. 'Property meets one everywhere. Property
blights everything. I am a poor chap. I
am cast out of employ; but I did think I had
my ewe lamb. And now Property comes
between me and her. Property says to me,
"Go—what I cannot consume I will destroy,
lest you have it." Do you think, you Cheap
Jack girl, that Mark Runham will marry
Kainie? He is a man of property, and property
hungers for property. She is like me. She
has nothing. She is a miller grinding nought
save water.'</p>

<p>He thrust the boat towards the shore.</p>

<p>'I'll not go to see her,' said Beamish. 'I could
not bear it. I'm off to the Duck at Isleham. I
shall meet there some fellows who love the
working people, and who will combine to teach

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>

these men who hold the Fens in their fists to
deal with their labourers justly and mercifully.'</p>

<p>He leaped ashore, mounted the bank, and,
standing there, extended his long arms and
expanded his great hands, and cried, 'I see the
day coming! I see the light about to break!
The trumpet will sound, and the dead and
crushed working men will rise and stand on their
feet. That will be a day of vengeance!—a day
of fire and consuming heat! Then will the fen-farmers
call to the earth to swallow them, and
to the isles to cover them, against the anger of
the dead men risen up in judgment against
them.'</p>

<p>'There comes Mark,' said Zita. 'I suppose I
must get him to punt me home. But I shall
not speak to him all the way.'</p>

</div>

<p class="center">BURNT HATS</p>

<p class="p1">AT the time of our tale, the Duck at Isleham—a
solitary inn on slightly rising
ground—was notorious as a place of resort for
poachers, a centre to which smuggled goods
were brought from the Wash, and whence they
were distributed, and a general rendezvous for the
dissatisfied. Not a bad trade was done at the
Duck. Thither came the poachers as to a mart
for the disposal of their game, and the dealers
to take the spoil of the poachers; thither came
not only those who brought, up the dark path
from the sea, spirits which had not paid duty,
but also the farmers who desired to lay in
supplies. As the fen-water was not potable
unmixed, it was a matter of necessity for the
fen-dwellers to temper it with something that
would neutralise its unpleasant savour as well
as kill its unwholesome elements. Moreover,
such being the case, those who desired to lay in
a stock of this counteracting agent went for it,
by a law of nature, to the cheapest shop, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

the cheapest shop was that where the traffic was
in spirits that were contraband. Lastly, at the
Duck assembled the great company of grumblers,
large everywhere, but especially large in the Fens.</p>

<p>As the Duck afforded space for a good many
grumblers in bar and kitchen and parlour, and
as grumblers like to grumble into the ears of
men of their own kidney, the Duck drew to it
the discontented of all classes—farmers dissatisfied
with their rent, yeomen dissatisfied at their
rates, artisans out of humour because trade was
slack, gangers, clayers, bankers, gaulters, slodgers,
millers, molers, gozzards—everyone whom the depressing
atmosphere of the Fens made dispirited,
and who thought the cause of his depression was
due to the oppression of some one else.</p>

<p>The kitchen of the Duck was full. A great
fire of turf was heaped up, and glowed red, diffusing
heat, but giving out no flame, and, notwithstanding
the tobacco smoke, filling the place with
its penetrating, peculiar odour. The men present—on
this occasion they were all men—were
drinking; they were mostly men of the class of
agricultural labourer. Among them were two or
three with dazed eyes, men silent, pallid, who
looked at the speakers and acquiesced in every
sentiment or opinion expressed, however contradictory
they might be. These were opium-eaters.</p>

<p>In the Fens, almost every cottage grows its
crop of white poppy in the small garden. Of
the poppy heads a tea is brewed. The mothers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>

are accustomed to work in the fields, hoeing
between the ranks of wheat. The rich soil that
produces the corn produces also weeds that
have to be kept under. That the babe may not
interfere with the mother earning a small wage,
it is given poppy tea, and that sends it to sleep
for the day. But the drops of opium thus administered
in infancy affect the tender brains,
bewilder them, and subject the child to nervous
pains. As it grows up to man or womanhood, it
has recourse to the drug to which it was brought
up in infancy. A large business in laudanum
is done in the Fens, and much of the distraught
mind and tortured nerve is due to this cause.
The poppy tea dispels trouble as surely as whisky,
and opium dulls pain at a cheaper and surer rate
than the surgeon who boggles over its removal.</p>

<p>'I tell you,' said Pip Beamish, 'it is due to
the farmers and yeomen. Look at them, up to
the eyes in gold, and gold that is squeezed out
of the fen by your hands. Till they have been
taught a lesson, and that a sharp and stinging
one, they will go on in the same way. No Acts
of Parliament will help us. You may send up
whom you will, Whig or Tory, to Westminster,
it is the same. No party will do aught for you.
No judges and no jury are of any avail, for law
can't come in and right us. We must do that
with our own hands. When a boy won't do the
right thing, you put a stick across his back and
make him; you don't ask for an Act of Parliament,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

you don't elect a member to teach him his
duty. We must teach our farmers as you teach
idle and thievish boys. Teach them in such a
way as they won't forget. Teach them to fear
the rod. Set the stackyards blazing throughout
the Fens, and by the light of those fires they'll
begin to see what is the way of justice and equity.'</p>

<p>'I don't see how that's going to lower the
price of wheat,' said a ganger, named Silas
Gotobed. 'You sez that the cost of bread is too
high. If you burn the wheatstacks, there will
be less corn, and up the price will go.'</p>

<p>'You're right there. That's reason, Silas,'
said a third, Thomas Goat, a gaulter. 'The
mischief don't lie with the farmers. They
grow the corn—some one must do that. The
wickedness is in the eaters.'</p>

<p>'Why, we're all eaters.'</p>

<p>'Ay!' said Goat sententiously. 'But we've
a right to eat; there be a lot eats as hasn't a
right to do so.'</p>

<p>'You mean rats and mice.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't—leastways not four-legged ones.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, then?'</p>

<p>'It is them collegers,' said Goat. 'I've been
to Cambridge. I've seen them there, a thousand
of them. They come up in swarms from every
part of England, and there they do nought but
eat and drink and row on the river, and play
cricket on Parker's Piece. Rowin' and playin'
cricket ain't qualifications for eatin'. What

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

would you say if a thousand rats, big as bullocks,
was to come on to the Fens and attack our
stacks? There'd be a pretty outcry. Every
man would take down his gun. The terriers
would be called for. Traps, poison would be
laid, and none quiet till every rat was exterminated.
Very well, up from every part of England
come these darned collegers to the Univarsity,
and spend their time there, eatin'—eatin'—eatin'.
Mates, I axes, what are they eatin'? It is the
wheat we grow on our fens. I calculate that one-half
of what we grow goes down into their stomicks.
If there were no collegers, then there'd be twice
as much corn, and corn would be at forty-eight
instead of ninety-six. It is that Univarsity and
them collegers does it. I have shown you that
as clear as these five fingers of mine. If that
ain't reason, show me where it is to be found.'</p>

<p>'I don't hold with you,' said Gotobed, impatient
at having his say snapped out of his mouth.
'I suppose collegers must eat somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Let them stay and eat at home.'</p>

<p>'Well, but what about the price of wheat at their
homes? Won't they diminish the supply there?'</p>

<p>'That don't concern us,' shouted a clayer
named Gathercole. 'It is no odds to us what
the supply and what the price is elsewhere.
All that concerns us is the supply and the price
here in the Fens. Goat, you've hit the wrong
nail on the head! I know better than you; it's
the bankers does it.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>'What have you to say against the bankers?'
asked Goat. 'I'd like to know where the corn
would be if the bankers did not keep the rivers
from overflow.'</p>

<p>'I mean those who have banks in towns,'
explained Gathercole. 'I've been to Mortlock's
in Ely. I've seen what the clerks do there.
They have drawers full of gold. They don't
trouble to put their fingers to it, they shovel it
in and shovel it out like muck. Whence does
Mortlock get all that gold, I ask. It comes out
of the Fens. The farmers are such dizzy-fools
that they put their money there for Mortlock
to take care of, and Mortlock sends the money
out of the country to America. What's the
advantage of the farmers growing corn, and of
the labourers helping to grow it, what's the
pleasure to reap and sow and plough and mow
and be a farmer's boy, if all the money earned
and addled goes into Mortlock's bank, and Mortlock
sends it to America? I wish I was in Parliament
one week, and I'd hang every banker in
the country, and burn every ship as takes the
money out of England and carries it to America.'</p>

<p>'I say it is the millers,' said Isaac Harley, a
clayer. 'You send a sack of corn to the soak-mill,
and you get back half a sack of flour.
How is that? There should be as much flour
come back as corn went, but there does not. I
have proved it scores of times. I've sent a sack
so full of wheat that I could scarce bind the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

mouth, and when it came back as flour it was but
half full. That is what makes corn so dear—the
millers steal it. If I were king for half a day, I'd
drown every miller in England in his own dam.'</p>

<p>'You are all of you out,' said a small landowner,
named Abraham Cutman. 'But it is
like your ignorance. You feel that the shoe
pinches, but you don't know where it pinches,
and why it pinches. I will tell you. I have
education, and you have not. It is the rates.
We are paying from six to seven shillings an
acre for the drainage of the Fens. The rate
has been up to ten shillings and sixpence.
Why should we pay that? We can't afford to
pay seven shillings an acre in rates, and pay
our workmen well also. All the profits are
consumed in rates. The Commissioners stick
it on, and they can't help it; they must have the
banks kept up and the mills in working order.'</p>

<p>'Of course they must,' threw in the gaulter.</p>

<p>'They must have their mills,' said Beamish.
'But why am I thrown out of employ, that did
no wrong, and never neglected my duty?'</p>

<p>'Silence all round. Listen to me,' said Cutman.
'The wrong lies here. Take off the rate,
and the price of corn will go down, and the price
of labour will go up.'</p>

<p>'That's it. Cutman has it!' exclaimed several.</p>

<p>But Goat dissented. 'There must be a rate,' said
he, 'or how should I be paid for my gaulting?
and without gaulting there can be no banking.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>'Of course there must be a rate. I'd have
it permanently fixed by Act of Parliament at
fifteen shillings an acre.'</p>

<p>'You would?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I would; so that gaulters and bankers
should have double wages. They work hard
and deserve it.'</p>

<p>'Right you are, master,' said Goat; but others
murmured.</p>

<p>'Why should gaulters and bankers only have
double pay? Why not molers and gozzards
also?' others again asked. 'How about the
price of wheat then?'</p>

<p>'I said I'd have the rate fixed at fifteen
shillings an acre,' pursued Cutman, looking
about him with an air of superiority. 'Fifteen
shillings an acre—not a penny less. But I'd
have the rate shifted from fen-land as wants
draining to all other land in Great Britain as
doesn't want draining. The rate should be laid
on all other shoulders except ours. Stick a
rate on to Mortlock's and all bankers. Stick
it on to the colleges and the universities. Stick
it on to all high and dry lands, where there is no
call for banking and draining. Stick it on
where you like, only take it off from the Fens.
Why should we pay rates for draining our land
when the farmers on high ground pay nothing?
They have their land six or seven shillings an
acre cheaper than do we. If I were in the
Ministry, the first thing I would do would be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>

to impose a compulsory rate of fifteen shillings
an acre on all land that didn't want draining,
to pay for the draining of land that did want it.
Then we'd have high times of it here in the
Fens—farmers, bankers, slodgers, all round. If
that is not reason, and you don't see it, so
much the worse for your intelligences.'</p>

<p>'I don't call that reason at all,' said Goat.
'Don't tell me the Commissioners would pay
us double wages when the rate was at fifteen.
It is six now, and I get eleven shillings a week.
Twelve years ago it was half a guinea rate, and
then my wage was ten shillings. If the rate
were up to fifteen I should be wuss off. Every
four shillings the rate goes up my wage goes
down a shilling. With the rate at fifteen, I'd
be worse off—with a wage of five and sixpence,
or six shillings at most. I hold to it that
the mischief lies in the Univarsity, with them
collegers a-eatin'—eatin'—eatin'. I'll fight at
flap-chap any man as disputes my argiment.'</p>

<p>'I dispute it,' said Silas Gotobed, starting up.</p>

<p>'Very well. We'll find out which has the
best of the argiment and reason on his side
with flap-chaps.'</p>

<p>'My argiment is this,' said Gotobed. 'Rivers
ought to run uphill. If they don't choose to,
they should be made to, by Act of Parliament.
Then we'd be dry, and them on high grounds
would be wet. Then they'd have the rates
and the bother, and we'd be free. That is my

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

contention, and it's all gammon about them
collegers.'</p>

<p>He placed himself opposite Goat.</p>

<p>'I don't care what you may call yourself,'
said he to his opponent, 'Goat or sheep; but
you're an ass, and every one knows it.'</p>

<p>Then Ephraim Beamish ran between the men,
who stood facing each other with threatening looks.</p>

<p>'Be reasonable,' he said, thrusting them apart
with his long arms. 'Why do you fly at each
other, instead of at the common foe?'</p>

<p>'I don't know what be the common foe,' retorted
Goat, 'if it bain't the collegers. If I was
in Parliament'—</p>

<p>'It's the bankers,' said Jonas Gathercole. 'If
I was in Parliament'—</p>

<p>'It's the millers!' shouted Harley. 'If I was
in Parliament'—</p>

<p>'It's the rates!' exclaimed Cutman; 'and a law
should be made, and shall be when I'm in Parliament'—</p>

<p>'You're every one out!' roared Silas Gotobed;
'it's Providence, as don't do what it should be
made to do, and force the rivers to run uphill.'</p>

<p>'Sit down! you're drunk,' cried Cutman.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to be ordered about by you,'
retorted the ganger; 'we're all equal here. I
haven't been bankrupt and sold my stacks twice
over.'</p>

<p>Cutman fell into the rear. He had been
guilty of fraudulent conduct at his bankruptcy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>'I say it is the Univarsity, and I maintains my
argiment,' said Goat. 'I'll prove it on your chaps.'</p>

<p>'I sez it is the rivers ought to run uphill. I'll
box your donkey ears if you denies it. That's
my argiment.'</p>

<p>Gotobed made a lunge at this opponent and
missed him. Flap-chaps is a pastime affected in
the Fens, more so in former times than at present,
but not out of favour now. It consists in this.
Two men face each other and endeavour to
slap each other's cheeks, right or left, as best
they can, and as best they can to ward off with
the same open palm the blows aimed at their
own chaps. Those who play this game acquire
great dexterity at it, but when much ale or
spirits has been drunk, then the eye has lost its
quickness of perception, the hand its steadiness,
the brain its coolness, and the contest rapidly
degenerates into a drunken brawl and a roll on
the floor, with fisticuffs and head-bumping.</p>

<p>It promised to so degenerate on the present
occasion. Gotobed was the most intoxicated
and least able to parry the blows levelled at
him, and every time Goat's hand made his cheek
sting, it roused him to a further access of fury
that blinded him to what he was about; he
withdrew his left hand from behind his back.
This provoked an outcry from the lookers-on of,
'Not fair play! Hand back! hand back!'</p>

<p>Beamish again endeavoured to interpose, but
came off with both his ears tingling; he had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>

received a blow on one cheek from Goat, and
on the other from Gotobed. The strife recommenced
after this futile attempt to separate the
men. Slap, slap, on the chaps of Gotobed,
followed by a blow from his fist in the face of
his adversary. This occasioned a yell from all
in the room of 'Cheat—not fair! a fine! a fine,
Silas! Fair game or none at all.'</p>

<p>'I'll pay a fine indeed!' roared Gotobed.
Then, springing at his opponent, who staggered
stupefied under the blow he had received, he
snatched his hat from his head, and, thrusting
it into the fire, shouted, 'Caps! Caps!' Then
he dashed at Cutman, who wore a white beaver.</p>

<p>'Your hat!' he demanded.</p>

<p>'You shall not have it. It is as good as
new.'</p>

<p>'I will have it,' answered Gotobed. 'Ain't
we all equal? Isn't it the rule? What are you
better than me? One cap—all caps. That's
the rule.'</p>

<p>He tore the white beaver out of the yeoman's
hands, and rammed it with his ironshod boot
into the glowing turf fire.</p>

<p>'Mates! Mates! Show up your caps!'</p>

<p>Then ensued wild confusion. Some snatched
the caps and hats from those who were near
them, some endeavoured to protect their own
headgear from confiscation, and fought for
them. Some thrust their own caps into the
flames, and in ten minutes there was not one in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

the company but was without a cover for his
crown.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Beamish had made angry resistance. Three
men assailed him, tripped him up, and sent him
sprawling on the alehouse floor. A fourth
wrenched his hat away and thrust it into the
flames, shouting, 'You're a fine chap to say all
men are equal, and want to keep your own hat
when the rest are bareheaded.'</p>

<p>The landlord stepped outside, to see that the
fiery tinder did not fall on and ignite the thatch.
He returned and said, 'It is snowing.'</p>

<p>'Snowing, is it?' said Gotobed, staggering to
the door. 'Then we shall all wear white night-caps
to cool our heads.' Standing in the doorway,
sustaining himself by a hand on each of the jambs,
looking in, he shouted to his comrades, 'I am
right. You are all wrong. At next election I
ain't going to vote for no candidate as won't
promise to make the rivers run uphill. Nothing
will be as it ought to be—price of corn won't be
low, and wages won't be high, and farmers cease
to oppress, and bankers to send the money out
of this country, and millers to fill their fists with
flour, and Commissioners to pocket money that
ought to have gone to the gangers, and collegians
to cease to eat—till Providence has been forced to
do what it ort—and make the rivers run uphill.'</p>

Burnt caps is a curious and inexplicable custom in the Fens.
It is one that terminates many a brawl. If one man burns the
hat of another, it is <i>de rigueur</i> that all the rest of the company
should surrender their headgear to complete the holocaust.</p>

<p class="center">A CRAWL ABROAD</p>

<p class="p1">NO country in the world is so subject to
variations in the climate as England,
and in no part of England are the variations so
felt as in the Fens. No hills, no belts of trees
there break the force of the wind. The gales
rush over the plains unresisted from every
quarter. Elsewhere there are hedgerows, on
the sunny side of which appear the celandine
and primrose in early spring, then the red-robin,
the bluebell, our lady's smock, and the
gorgeous spires of foxglove later still. There
are no hedgeflowers in the Fens, for there are
no hedges. Elsewhere the landscape is variegated
with coppice that is brown in autumn
and pine woods that are dark green all the year.
It is not so in the Fens. There are no trees.
When the snow falls, it envelops the entire
surface in white.</p>

<p>The frost had passed away, and the waters
had been released. With the thaw the mills

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>

had been set again in motion, and the sails flew
fast to make up for lost time. Now again a
single night had altered the complexion of the
fen-land. All was white that had been black.
The snow had filled the ruts, and, consolidating,
had formed a comparatively smooth surface.
Rivers and dykes were not frozen, only a little
cat ice had formed among the reeds.</p>

<p>Zita was in the farmyard. She had gone there
to put her van to rights. The van demanded her
attention. The fowls had taken to roosting on
the top, and had made it untidy. There was no
keeping them away. They could be, and they
were, excluded from the interior of the van,
but not from the shed in which the van stood.
Formerly, they had been satisfied with rafters
and manger; now, whether out of perversity or
love of variety, or because the van satisfied their
ideal, they deserted their ancient roosting-places
and crowded the van roof.</p>

<p>This was a source of incessant annoyance to
Zita, who could not endure the degradation to
which the van was subjected. Every few days
she visited the shed, pail and scrubbing-brush
in hand, and thoroughly cleansed the conveyance.</p>

<p>She had been thus engaged, and had flung the
dirty water at a clucking hen that sauntered
up with purpose to resume its perch on the
van top, when a pair of hands was laid on her
shoulders, and, looking round, she saw Mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>'What has brought you here?' she asked in
surprise.</p>

<p>'What but your own sweet self. I have not
seen you for some days. As you were not
outside the farmyard, I have come into it to
seek you.'</p>

<p>'You ought not to have done so. The master
will be angry.'</p>

<p>'He is from home. I saw him ride to Ely.'</p>

<p>'But if he hears that you have been here?'</p>

<p>'You need not tell him.'</p>

<p>'I will not tell him, but others may—mischief-makers.
Then I shall suffer.'</p>

<p>'You can take care of yourself, I warrant.'</p>

<p>'You are right, I can protect myself. I am
not a servant, but a lodger. I pay for everything
I receive and consume here—even for
this soap and the use of this pail.'</p>

<p>'And this is the van?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that is my old home. I was born in it.
I have lived in it all my life. Whatever I know
I have learned in it. It is a fine thing to crawl
over the world like a snail, with one's house on
one's back.'</p>

<p>'The snail-crawling is over with you now.
You refused to let me go with you.'</p>

<p>'Yes; it is over for the winter. What I may
do when the spring comes, I cannot say. My
blood runs, my feet tingle. When the white
butterflies are about, I daresay I shall spread my
wings also. I mean my red and gold curtains.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>'And I may go with you?' mischievously.</p>

<p>'No; if I go, I go alone.'</p>

<p>'Let me walk round and admire your house
on wheels.'</p>

<p>'You do not see it to advantage,' said Zita
regretfully. 'It is not dressed out. The pans
and brushes and mats are stowed away, that
make it glitter just like a lifeguardsman. The
inside is taken out. The curtains are unhung.
And then those dratted fowls are a nuisance.
They have taken a fancy to the van. If Master
Drownlands and I were on better terms, I'd ax
him to have the fowls killed, or the shed boarded
up, that they might not come in.'</p>

<p>'What? you are not on good terms with
old Ki?'</p>

<p>'Only middling. I have had to teach him to
keep his distance.'</p>

<p>'Oh! he wanted to come to too close quarters—small
blame to him,' said Mark, laughing.</p>

<p>'He and I could not agree about terms—that
was it,' said Zita, with an impatient and annoyed
toss of her head.</p>

<p>'Let the van come to my place,' said Runham.
'Then I will stow it away out of reach of all
fowls.'</p>

<p>Zita shook her head. 'I like to look at my
van every day.'</p>

<p>'Well, that is no reason against sending it to
Crumbland. If you come to look at it twice a
day, so much the better pleased I shall be.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>'I cannot send the van anywhere where I
am not living, and this is my lodging for the
winter,' said Zita.</p>

<p>'And how goes the horse?' asked Mark.</p>

<p>'He don't go at all,' replied the girl. 'He
eats and thinks and gets bloated. He hasn't
enough to do. I'm afraid he'll be out of health.'</p>

<p>'Let us have him into the shafts and trot him
out a bit.'</p>

<p>'What? in the van?'</p>

<p>'Of course, in the van.'</p>

<p>Zita flushed with pleasure. 'I shall love it
above all things—but trot he won't. He never
trotted in his life but once, and that was on the
fifth of November. A gipsy had tied a Roman
candle to his tail. He trotted then. After
every flare and pop he went on at a run, then
he stopped and looked behind him for an explanation.
Then away went the Roman candle
again, and a great globe of fire shot away high
over the roof of the van. At that Jewel trembled
and trotted on once more. Father was away.
I was younger then by some years, and it
frightened me. I did not dare to touch the
Roman candle. Jewel ran about two miles,
and when the firework was exhausted, he stood
still, and, with thinking about it, and trying to
understand and unable, fell asleep in the middle
of the road. Father found us there, and he tried
to persuade Jewel to return the two miles, but
he was obstinate—tremenjous—and wouldn't

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>

move. At last father was forced to tie a Roman
candle to his nose, and that drove him backwards
the two miles. But I don't think Jewel
ever quite got over the surprise of that fifth of
November.'</p>

<p>When Mark had done laughing at Zita's story,—and
Zita laughed as she told it, and laughed
when it was over, because Mark's laugh was
irresistible,—then the young fellow said, 'It will
be fun for me, pleasure to you, it will exercise
the horse, and freshen and sweeten the van.
We will go a drive, in preparation for the grand
tour in the spring. Where is the harness? I'll
rig the grey up.'</p>

<p>'You do not know how to set about it,' said
Zita.</p>

<p>'What? not know how to harness a horse?'</p>

<p>'You do not know Jewel. He has to be
talked to, and his reason convinced. He has
his fancies, and they must be humoured. He
knows my voice and the touch of my hand,
whereas you are a stranger.'</p>

<p>Zita went to find Jewel and put the horse in
the shafts. Whilst thus engaged, she talked to
Mark.</p>

<p>'The master had him out one day, and put
him in the plough. It offended Jewel, who was
not accustomed to that sort of thing. He set his
feet straight down, stiffened his legs, back went
his ears, he curled his under lip, and looked out
at the corners of his eyes. Not a step would he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>

take; it hurt his self-respect. Now, wait here
by Jewel's head whilst I go indoors after the
crimson curtains and gold tassels. I could not
drive without them; it would not be showing
proper regard for the van, and it might hurt
Jewel's feelings. It won't take five minutes to
rig up the curtains, and whilst I am after them,
you can make friends with the horse. Go in
front of him and speak flattering words; say
how shapely are his legs, and how silken is his
hair; but, whatever you do, not a word about
the Roman candles, or he'll never take kindly
to you.'</p>

<p>'All right, Zita. Where is the whip?'</p>

<p>'Whip? bless you! he don't want a whip.
Why, the crack of a whip would so frighten him
that he would sit down. He'd suppose it was
fifth of November again. He'd curl his tail
under him, and lay his nose between his legs,
and set back his ears, but keep an eye open,
watching you and winking.'</p>

<p>Eventually, the van was considered by Zita to
be sufficiently decorated to be got under way,
and Jewel was induced, by flattery and caresses,
to start along the drove.</p>

<p>The van was lighter than Jewel had ever
known it to be, and he might have been expected
to take this into consideration, and
accelerate his pace; but, under the supposition
that by so doing he would be establishing a
precedent that might be quoted on a future

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

occasion, he adopted his wonted pace, as when
drawing the van laden with its many and
multifarious contents.</p>

<p>'The thing jolts—rather,' said Mark, laughing.
'What would become of the goods, were they
here?'</p>

<p>'They would be thrown all over the shop,'
answered Zita. 'That is why I am at Prickwillow.
I cannot get away. Jewel could not
pull the laden van along the drove; and if other
horses were attached to it, everything would be
shaken to pieces.'</p>

<p>Presently Jewel came to a halt.</p>

<p>'Shall I jump out and urge him on?' asked Mark.</p>

<p>'No; he is breathing. He will go on again
presently.'</p>

<p>'And whilst he is breathing, we will talk.
Conversation is impossible when we are bumping
into ruts and bouncing over clods. If this
be travelling when there is snow half-choking
the wheelruts and levelling the clods, what must
it be at other times?'</p>

<p>'You see I am a prisoner at Prickwillow. I
cannot get away without the loss of all my
possessions.'</p>

<p>'I see that now.'</p>

<p>Presently Mark said, 'Zita, why were you on
the river with Pip Beamish the other day?'</p>

<p>'I hired him with half a pound of bird's eye
to punt me up stream. He behaved unfair; he
went off and left me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>'And I had to bring you back—and mighty
cross you were. Was that because Beamish
had left you?'</p>

<p>'I had cause to be cross when Beamish took
the bird's eye and did not half do the job. Now
cling hard; Jewel is moving forward, and we
must hold to our seats to save being tumbled
about and broken to bits.'</p>

<p>Mark was on one side of the van, Zita on the
other. He put out his hand to the curtains at
one lurch, and roused Zita to remonstrance.</p>

<p>'The curtains are for ornament, and are not
to be touched. They are of velvet plush. I
don't want to have your great hand marking
them. Lay hold of a rail. No! not a gold
tassel; you would pull that down, and maybe
bring away the whole concern. Oh!'</p>

<p>This exclamation was provoked by the off
wheel sinking into a rut, the depth of which
seemed unfathomable. The movement of the
van was like that of the mail steamer that runs
from Dover to Calais, in a chopping sea. At
one bound Zita was propelled forward, and, had
she not clung to the ribs of the vehicle, would
have been shot head foremost against the
opposite side of the van, with the result of either
perforating that side or of flattening her skull
against it.</p>

<p>Then, at the recoil lurch, Mark was projected
in the opposite direction, and was nearly cast
into Zita's lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>'I say, Zita, the exertion is prodigious!' exclaimed
the lad. 'I think I should prefer to
walk.'</p>

<p>'But the honour is so great,' gasped Zita.
'It is not every day you can ride in such a
conveyance as this, and have velvet curtains
flapping, and gold tassels bobbing about your
head.'</p>

<p>'I'll try to think of it in that light.'</p>

<p>'Besides,' pursued Zita, 'a shake up is as good
as medicine to the insides. It puts them on
their good behaviour. They are so tremenjous
afraid of having it again.'</p>

<p>'But surely progress in this affair is not
always like this.'</p>

<p>'Of course not. It is only in the Fens there
are droves. It was bad at times where a highway
had been new stoned. Then father and I
clung to the perishables.'</p>

<p>'How do you mean?'</p>

<p>'We took them in our arms, or held them. If
we were bruised, it did not matter; we mend up
according to nature; but pots and pans don't.
We always lost something, though. There was
that tea-kettle that troubled father's last hours—it
got a hole in it going over a bit of new road.'</p>

<p>This conversation took place in fits and starts,
between the joltings of the van. Presently
Jewel thought he had sufficiently exerted himself;
he heaved a long sigh, looked back over
his shoulder, and stood still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>'There, now,' said Runham, pulling a large
red, white-spotted kerchief from his pocket and
mopping his brow, 'Jewel is breathing, and so
may we. This is agonies.'</p>

<p>'I call it pleasure,' said Zita. 'It must be,
because it isn't business.'</p>

<p>'What did the horse mean by looking back
at us, as he did just now when he sighed?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he thinks it is his duty, now father's gone,
to keep an eye on us.'</p>

<p>'I suppose, if I were to square accounts, as
the other day'—</p>

<p>'He'd have an apoplexy. For goodness' sake
don't.'</p>

<p>'I say, why did you go with Pip Beamish
when you would not go with me?'</p>

<p>'I did not go with Beamish. He came with
me because I hired him. Tell me what took
you to Red Wings? Had you an account to
serve there?'</p>

<p>Mark became grave. He fidgeted on his seat.
He was an honest, open-hearted fellow, and disliked
prevarication, but there was hesitation,
there was evasion in his reply.</p>

<p>'I have business of all sorts with all kinds of
people.'</p>

<p>'That is no answer. I want to know why you
went to the mill to see Kainie.'</p>

<p>Mark rested his chin in his hand and considered.</p>

<p>'I don't mind saying so much,' he answered,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>

'but let it be between us alone. There is a sort
of a tie between her and me—a sort of a tie,
you know.'</p>

<p>'I know nothing.'</p>

<p>'I can't give you particulars. It's all right,—if
you knew, you would say so too,—but I can't
tell you more about it; and it's a tie can't be
got rid of.'</p>

<p>Further explanation was interrupted, for a
head and pair of shoulders appeared in front
between the curtains.</p>

<p>'Oh! you, Runham—and that Cheap Jack
girl! Which is it to be—she or Kainie? It
shall not be both.'</p>

<p>Pip Beamish was there, glowering at Mark
from under his bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>'Take care!' said Beamish, thrusting a long
arm into the van. 'Take care what you are
about. If you hurt one hair of the head of
Kainie, I'll shoot you through the heart. I've
time on my hands now. I'm turned out of my
mill by the Commissioners, and can choose my
occasion. I shall watch you. One or other—leave
my Kainie alone and stick to <em>her</em>.' He
indicated Zita with one hand.</p>

<p>'Pip,' said Mark, flushing very red, 'do not
talk nonsense!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense?' repeated Beamish; 'that is how
you rich men treat these matters—sport and
nonsense; but to us it is heartbreak and despair.
What have I but my one ewe lamb? I have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>

been expelled my mill because you Commissioners
think I'm a dangerous chap. You ain't
far wrong there. I'm dangerous to such as you
who are evil-doers. Take care, you Cheap Jack
girl, and make not yourself cheap to such as
Runham. He is free in his wealth to do as he
pleases. If he be the ruin of you, trusting in
him, will he lose his Commissioner's place? If
he destroy my happiness by bringing harm on
my Kainie, will the laws touch him? I may
not take a straw from his stables, but he may
rob me of my Kainie. He is rich—I am poor.'</p>

<p>'Pip! you are the man I desire to see. I will
speak to you of this matter. Judge nothing
before you hear me; and you, Zita, do not you
place any weight on his words—they are bitter
and false.'</p>

<p>'Bitter,' repeated Pip, 'but not false. Nothing
that you can say will change my mind. Nothing
will alter my purpose. I warn you against an
injury to Kainie. You rich men of the Fens do
not seek a poor girl to raise her head and set her
up on high among yourselves, but to humble her
in the dust.'</p>

<p>He laughed a fierce, scornful laugh.</p>

<p>'I cannot say—you Cheap Jack Zita. They
report that you have money and goods. Have
you told him how much? If it be worth his
while, he will be honourable towards you. It is
all a matter of calculation. If you ain't worth
much, he'll throw you over, as he would throw

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

over Kainie when tired of her. Best take care!
If you dare!'</p>

<p>The man's eyes glared with white heat, and
he thrust his long arm towards Mark with
clenched fist.</p>

<p>'Pip,' exclaimed Mark, 'you are the man I
have been wanting to see. I will come out to
you.'</p>

<p>He jumped out of the van. 'Your words are
folly.' Then, 'You drive home without me,
Zita. I told you I had business with all sorts
of persons; now I have business with Ephraim—business
of much consequence. May you get
safe back in that rattletrap, and not be shaken
to bits!'</p>

<p>'Rattletrap? Oh, if Jewel heard you!' She
spoke as laughing, to disguise her inward
trouble.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, was Mark gone than she
broke down and cried.</p>

<p>But her tears did not last long.</p>

<p>'He's venomous. He don't know all. I do
trust Mark. Besides—I've the van and money.'</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A DROP OF GALL</p>

<p class="p1">WHAT did Mark Runham mean by his
conduct?</p>

<p>He had left Zita to go after that fellow,
Pip Beamish, and they were together on the
embankment in close confabulation. The girl
looked after them from between the red curtains,
and could see Beamish gesticulating with his
long arms. He was excited, he was speaking
with vehemence, and at intervals Mark interrupted
him.</p>

<p>Something that Mark had said seemed to have
struck the orator with surprise. He dropped
his arms and stood like a figure of wood. He
let Mark lay his hand on his shoulder and draw
him along, speaking rapidly into his ear.</p>

<p>What this meant was plain to Zita. The
two men were rivals for Kainie of Red Wings.
They had been disputing; Beamish hot and
impatient, and unwilling to listen to the other.
What was Kainie? A she-miller, as Zita put

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

it, and ineligible as a wife to such as Runham.
Among fen-farmers no one marries for mere
love; money or land is the substance for which
they crave. If a little love be sprinkled on the
morsel, so much the better, but it is no essential—it
is a condiment. Zita tossed her head.
She was not a beggarly miller! She had the
van and its contents, red curtains and gold
tassels. She had money as well—the profits
of fair-days at Swaffham, Huntingdon, Wisbeach,
Cambridge, and Ely. She had a good deal of
money in her box—none suspected how much.
Of course her wealth would not compare with
that of a fen-farmer, but it was enough to place
her immeasurably above Kainie, and within
reach of Mark if he chose to stoop a little—just
a little.</p>

<p>Zita turned the head of Jewel homewards.
Mark did not follow her to say farewell. He had
given her no thanks for the jolting and jumbling
in the conveyance to which she had treated
him, though 'good as medicine to his insides.'</p>

<p>Zita was angry with the young man. She
did not relish the thought that he came to see
her one day and went to Kainie the next—nay,
that he visited both in the same afternoon.</p>

<p>It was true that he had made no overtures
to Zita—said nothing definite relative to his
condition of heart; but he had kissed her, and
would have done so again had she not warned
him that it would give the horse an apoplectic

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

fit. He had shown her plainly that he liked
her company, and that he was unhappy if he
did not see her daily.</p>

<p>His attentions had been noticed. Mrs. Tunkiss
had commented on them, and the girl with
St. Vitus' dance had made a joke about them.</p>

<p>His visit that day to Prickwillow would
inevitably have been seen. The unusual sight
of the van out on an airing must have attracted
attention. And if the van had been seen, those
who saw it were certain to speak of it to those
who did not. That expedition would come to
the ears of Drownlands.</p>

<p>Knowing what she did, Zita was able to
account for the dislike Drownlands showed to
the presence of Mark Runham. The sight of
the young man was a sting to his conscience.
He would be afraid lest Zita, in conversation
with him, might let drop something about the
events of the night on which Jake Runham died.</p>

<p>But Zita was woman enough to see that there
was another reason why the master of Prickwillow
eyed the young fellow with dislike. He
was jealous of him. Zita perceived that Drownlands
liked her, at the same time that he feared
her. She could discern in the expression of his
eye, read in his consideration for her comfort,
decipher in the quiver of his lips when Mark's
name was mentioned, that his regard for her
was deep, and that his dislike of Mark was due
to jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Zita was accustomed to admiration; she had
received a good deal of it in her public life, and
regarded it with contemptuous indifference; but
the admiration she had met with in market and
fair had been outspoken; this of Drownlands
was covert. Hitherto she had accepted it from
her vantage-ground—the platform of her own
habitation; now she was at a disadvantage—the
inmate of the house of the man who looked
on her with admiration.</p>

<p>She turned her thoughts again in the direction
of Mark. What were the ties binding him to
Kainie, of which he spoke?</p>

<p>On consideration, she thought she could
understand. Mark had fallen in love with the
girl at the mill when in hobbledehoydom, and
had stupidly plunged into an engagement. Boys
are fools; and he was but just emerged from
boyhood. His father's death had knocked the
nonsense out of his head, and brought him to
the consciousness that he had made a blunder.
He was now a rich farmer; Kainie had nothing
of her own but the clothes she stood up in.
Moreover, he had since seen Zita, and had
become sincerely attached to her. So long as
he was tied to that miller-girl, he could not
speak of his wishes and purposes to Zita. He
was in a dilemma; he was an honourable fellow,
and could not break his word to Kainie. Mark
was laying the case before Pip Beamish, and
was inviting Pip to take Kainie off his hands,
and set him free to speak out to Zita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well,' thought the girl, as she put up Jewel
in his stable, 'we all do foolish things; some of
us do wrong things at times in our life. I
have done both in one—I sold a box of paste-cutters
at one and nine that cost father two
shillings. I've had that threepence as hot
coppers on my soul ever since. Well! I hope
Pip Beamish will take Kainie. He loves her,
and he's suited to her—both are millers; one
has nothing and the other nought—so they are
fitted for a match. I'll help matters on, or try
to do so. I'll see Kainie, and have a deal with
her—she is but one of the general public after
all. I daresay she likes Pip quite as much as
Mark, and is doubting in her mind which to
have. I know what I can throw in to turn the
scale.'</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the van had been consigned
to its shed and the curtains removed to
her room, Zita knitted her fingers behind her
back and surveyed her goods, moving from one
group of wares to another.</p>

<p>After some consideration, she descended the
stairs and prepared to leave the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tunkiss peered out of the kitchen as she
heard her step, and said—</p>

<p>'Going to meet the master—be you?'</p>

<p>A malevolent smile was on her face.</p>

<p>'No, Mrs. Tunkiss. I do not know in which
direction he has ridden.'</p>

<p>'You'd like to know, would you? You'd go

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>

and meet him, and he'd jump off his horse and
walk alongside of you, and say soft things. Oh
my! The master! Ki Drownlands say soft
things!'</p>

<p>The woman burst into a cackling laugh.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked Zita, reddening
with anger at the insult implied in the woman's
words.</p>

<p>'Oh, miss, I mean nothing to offend. But I'd
like to know what the master will say to your
carawaning about with Mark Runham—what
the master will say to your receiving visits from
young men in the poultry-house.'</p>

<p>'That is no concern of yours; and for the
matter of that, I care nothing what he thinks.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear no! But folks can't carry on with
two at once. Two strings to a bow may be all
very well in some things. I don't mean to say
that you shouldn't sow clover with your corn,
and so have both a harvest of wheat and one of
hay; but with us poor women that don't do.
If it be a saying that we should have two strings
to one bow, there is another, that there's many
a slip between the cup and the lip.'</p>

<p>Zita pushed past the insolent woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tunkiss shouted after her, 'Strange
goings on—so folks say. There's Mark Runham
running after two girls, sweethearting both;
and there's one girl—I names no names—running
after two men, and I bet she catches neither.'</p>

<p>Then she slammed the kitchen door.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">NO DEAL</p>

<p class="p1">THE insolence of the housekeeper made
Zita for a while very angry. It followed
so speedily on the scene in the van with Ephraim
Beamish.</p>

<p>Her cheek burned as though it had been
struck, and her pulses throbbed. She would
like to have beaten Mrs. Tunkiss with one of
the flails; but with creatures of that sort it is
best not to bandy words, certainly not to give
them the advantage by losing temper and acting
with violence.</p>

<p>Zita did not long harbour her resentment.
She had other matters to occupy her mind
beside Mrs. Tunkiss.</p>

<p>The air was fresh and bracing to the spirits
as well as to the body. Zita walked on with
elastic tread, for she had recovered her good
humour. She wore a neat white straw bonnet
trimmed with black, and a white kerchief was
drawn over her shoulders and bosom. Her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

gown was black. She looked remarkably handsome.
She had been accustomed to wear her
gowns short, and her neat ankles were in white
stockings. She was strongly shod; the snow
brushed all the gloss off her shoes, but it was
not whiter than her stockings. She walked
along with a swing of the shoulders and a toss
of the head that were peculiar to her, and characteristic
of her self-confidence. The winter sun
was setting, and sent its red fire into her face;
it made her hair blaze, and brought out the
apricot richness of her complexion.</p>

<p>When she reached the brick platform of Red
Wings, Wolf did not bark, but ran to her,
wagging his tail. She had not forgotten him.
From her pocket she produced some bread.
Then, in acknowledgment, he uttered a couple
of sharp barks, and thrust his head against her
hand for a caress.</p>

<p>Kerenhappuch, hearing the barks, came out
and saluted Zita cordially.</p>

<p>'That's fine,' said she. 'Step inside. I was
just going to brew some tea.'</p>

<p>'I'm here on business,' answered Zita. 'Let
me sit down on one side of the fire and we'll
talk about it. Let's deal.'</p>

<p>'Deal? What do you mean?'</p>

<p>Zita drew a stool to the fireside. The turf
glowed red. The stool was low; when she
seated herself, her knees were as high as her
bosom. She folded her arms round them and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>

closed her hands, lacing her fingers together
and looking smilingly over her knees at Kainie,
with a gleam in her face of expectant triumph.
Kainie knelt at the hearth and put on the kettle.
She turned her head and watched Zita, whose
features were illumined by the fire glow, as they
had been shortly before by that of the setting
sun. Kerenhappuch could not refrain from
saying, 'What an uncommon good-looking girl
you are!'</p>

<p>'Yes, so most folks say,' responded Zita, with
indifference; 'and I suppose I am that.'</p>

<p>Kainie was somewhat startled at this frank
acceptance of homage. She pursed up her lips
and offered no further compliments.</p>

<p>'I suppose Pip Beamish is sweet on you,'
said Zita,—'tremenjous?'</p>

<p>'Poor fellow!' sighed the girl of the mill.
'Perhaps he is, but it is no good. He has not
got even a mill to look after now, and I have
barely enough wage to keep me alive. What is
more, the Commissioners are against him, and
won't let him get any work in the fen any
more.'</p>

<p>'Then let him go out of the fen?'</p>

<p>'Out of the fen?' exclaimed Kainie. 'How
you talk! As if a fen-man could do that!
You don't find frogs on top of mountains, nor
grow bulrushes in London streets. That ain't
possible.'</p>

<p>'But there are fens elsewhere.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'I do not know. In America, I suppose.
There is all sorts of country there, to suit all
sorts of people. I'd go there if I were he.'</p>

<p>'If there are fens in America, that's another
matter. But what is it you want with me, now,
partick'ler?'</p>

<p>Zita settled herself in her seat.</p>

<p>'I've come to have a deal with you,' she said
chirpily. 'That is what I have come about.'</p>

<p>'But—what do you want of me?'</p>

<p>'We will come to that presently,' said the
Cheap Jack girl, and with her usual craft or
experience she added, 'I will let you know
what my goods are before I name the price.'</p>

<p>'Price—money? I have no money.'</p>

<p>'It is not money I want.'</p>

<p>'I do not fancy there's anything I require,'
said Kerenhappuch. 'And that is fortunate, for
I have not only no money to buy with, but no
place where I could stow away a purchase.'</p>

<p>'Nobody knows what they wants till they see
things or hear about them,' said Zita. 'Bless
you! if you were as well acquainted with the
British public as father and me, you'd say that.
Take it as a rule, folks always set their heads
on having what they never saw before, didn't
know the use of, and don't know where to put
'em when they have 'em. I'm telling you this,
though it is not to my advantage. Now, what
do you say to a ream of black-edged paper and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>

mourning envelopes to match?—that's twenty
quires, you know.'</p>

<p>'I write to nobody. I have no relations but
my Uncle Drownlands, and he never speaks to
me—won't notice me. I am not likely to write
letters to him.'</p>

<p>'Then what do you say to a garden syringe?
If you have a pail of soapsuds, it is first-rate for
green-fly. Father sold several to gentlefolks
with conservatories.'</p>

<p>'But I don't belong to the gentlefolks, nor
have I got a conservatory.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Zita, rearranging herself on her
seat. 'But if you wanted to keep folks off your
platform, you could squirt dirty water over
them.'</p>

<p>'I have Wolf. He is sufficient.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Zita, with a slight diminution of
buoyancy in her spirits and of confidence in her
tone, 'then I'll offer you what I would not give
every one the chance of having. I offer it to you
as a particular friend. It's an epergne.'</p>

<p>'An epergne? What's that?'</p>

<p>'It is a sort of an ornament for a dinner-table.
I will not tell you any lies about it. Father got
it in a job lot, and cheap considering how
splendid it is. It is not the sort of goods we go
in for. It lies rather outside our line of business;
and yet there's no saying whether it might not
hit the fancy of General Jackass—I mean the
public—that was father's way of talking of it.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

You really can't tell what won't go down with
him. Will you have the epergne?'</p>

<p>'I'm not General Jackass, and I won't have it.'</p>

<p>'But consider—if you was to give a dinner-party,
and'—</p>

<p>'What? in the mill?'</p>

<p>'No; When you marry a rich man.'</p>

<p>'If I have any man, it will be a poor one.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Zita in a caressing tone, 'I know
what you really must have, and what there is no
resisting. It is the beautifullest little lot of
perfumes. They're all in a glass box, with
cotton wool, and blue ribbons round their necks.
There's Jockey Club—there's Bergamot—there's
Frangipani—there's New-mown Hay—there's
White Heliotrope, and there's Lavender too. I
am sure there is yet another; yes, Mignonette.
One for every day of the week. Think of that!
You can scent yourself up tremenjous, and a
different scent every day of the week. You
cannot refuse that.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Kainie, with a wavering in her
tone, a token of relaxation in resistance to the
allurements presented to her imagination, 'what
do you want for this?'</p>

<p>'One thing only.'</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p>'Give up Mark.'</p>

<p>'Mark Runham?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Mark Runham. Is it a deal between
us? Now listen.' Zita held up one hand, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>

began again with the catalogue of perfumes.
'There is Jockey Club for Sunday;' she touched
her thumb. 'There is Bergamot for Monday;'
she touched the first finger. 'There is Frangipani
for Tuesday, and New-mown Hay for
Wednesday'—</p>

<p>'Give up Mark?' Kainie interrupted the list.
'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'What I mean is this,' said Zita: 'Mark told
me that he was tied to you somehow.'</p>

<p>'He did? It is true.'</p>

<p>'But I want you to throw him up. Let him
go free. Say that there is no bond between you.
Think how you will smell, if you do! White
Heliotrope on Thursday, then Lavender on
Friday, and Mignonette on Saturday.'</p>

<p>'Did Mark say how we were tied—bound?'</p>

<p>'No; he only told me there was such a tie.'</p>

<p>'And Mark—did he set you to ask this?'</p>

<p>'No, not exactly. It is my idea. Now do.
You shall have all the perfumes. Consider how
on Sunday you will make the Baptist Chapel
smell of Jockey Club!'</p>

<p>'Give up Mark? Break the bond? I can't.
I could not, even if I would.'</p>

<p class="center">DAGGING</p>

<p class="p1">WHEN Zita returned to Prickwillow, Leehanna
Tunkiss, with a malicious leer,
said, 'The master is upstairs, and would like to
speak with you;' then, with a sidelong look at
the maid-of-all-work and a giggle, she curtseyed
and added 'Miss.'</p>

<p>Zita ascended leisurely to her room, removed
her bonnet and changed her shoes, put on an
apron, and then proceeded to Drownlands' office.
She did not hurry herself. She sauntered along
the passage and hummed a folk-melody—'High
Germany.' She stayed to shut a bedroom door
that was ajar and swinging in the draught. She
trifled with a canary that hung in a window.</p>

<p>The office door was open. She knew that
Drownlands had heard her come in, had heard
Mrs. Tunkiss inform her that she was wanted,
heard her ascend the stairs. She knew that he
was waiting with impatience whilst she removed
bonnet and shoes, that he was chafing at the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>

leisurely manner in which she approached his
den.</p>

<p>After a while she tapped at the half-open
door in careless fashion, threw it open and stood
in the doorway, and shrugged her shoulders,
then rubbed her hands as though they were
cold.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Tunkiss said you required my presence.'</p>

<p>'You have taken your time in coming.'
Drownlands was at his table; he had been
biting his fingers. There was a sheet of blotting
paper on the board; he had scratched it, torn
four strips out of it with his nails. His face
was troubled and was working. 'Why did you
not come at once?'</p>

<p>'I had to remove my shoes; they were wet.
I did not suppose you were in much of a
hurry.'</p>

<p>'Come inside. Why do you stand in the
doorway?'</p>

<p>She obeyed.</p>

<p>'Well, is it necessary to leave the door wide
open behind you?'</p>

<p>She closed the door.</p>

<p>'Shut it, I say.'</p>

<p>She obeyed, and leaned her back against the
valve, crossed her feet, and put her hands behind
her on the handle.</p>

<p>'Where have you been?' asked Drownlands
imperiously.</p>

<p>'To Red Wings, to see your niece. You

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>

don't know her. It is a pity. You should
look after her; she is your own relation. She
is not bad in her way, but awfully poor—and
pig-headed too, which poor people oughtn't to
be, because they can't afford it. I went to have
a deal with her, but it was of no use. She
would do no business with me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you have gone back to your old profession
of Cheap Jack, have you?'</p>

<p>'I never left it off. I Cheap Jack in my sleep
and make thundering profits. It is disappointing
to wake in the morning and see all the
goods—and damaged ones too—on the shelves
where they were the night before, after I had
sold them off in my dreams at twenty-five and
thirty per cent. profits. There's an epergne has
been the nightmare to father and me. I wanted
Kainie to take it, but she wouldn't. Suppose
you buy it and present it to her, and so make
peace and love between you?'</p>

<p>'Have done. I told you I did not wish you
to know her.'</p>

<p>'But I went on business, and my time was
wasted.'</p>

<p>'You have also been with that—that fellow.'</p>

<p>'Yes, with Mark. I took him out for a
drive.'</p>

<p>'In the road, in the van?'</p>

<p>'Yes; the van wanted sweetening. The fowls
have been roosting on it, and have treated it
shamefully.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>'Be silent. What are you playing with
behind your back?'</p>

<p>'I am playing with nothing. I am always at
work or doing business. I never play.'</p>

<p>'And what work or business are you engaged
on now?'</p>

<p>'I am polishing the handle of the door.'</p>

<p>'You not play? You never play?' exclaimed
Drownlands, starting to his feet. 'You are
always at play, and I am your sport. You play
me as a fish, you dagg me like a pike. Look at
this.'</p>

<p>He went to the corner of his room, and from
the collection there thrown together produced
a singular weapon or tool, locally termed a
gleve.</p>

<p>'Do you know the use of this?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'It is for playing,' said Drownlands bitterly.
'See, there are six knives tied together by the
handles at the head, and all the blades have
been jagged like saws, the teeth set backwards.
Can you guess its purpose?'</p>

<p>'No; it's not a woman's tool.'</p>

<p>'It is for playing—playing with pike. You
take this and dagg into the water; you dagg
and dagg, and bring up a pike or an eel wedged
between these blades, cut into by these fangs.
He cannot free himself; the more he twists
and turns, the deeper into his flesh bite these
teeth, and the greater is his anguish of heart.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>

That is play—play for him who does the dagging,
not for the poor fish that is speared. And,
Zita, such is your play. With your fingers, with
your tongue, with your brown eyes, you dagg
for me, and I am the miserable wretch whom
you torture. It may be fun to you.'</p>

<p>'I do not make sport with you, master,' said
Zita, with placidity of feature and evenness of
tone in strong contrast with his working face
and quivering voice.</p>

<p>'You are at that handle again. Polishing it!
Leave off, or you will drive me mad. Can you
not for one moment desist from tormenting me?
You seek out occasion, means, to twang my
every nerve, and give me pain.'</p>

<p>'Master Drownlands, listen to me,' said Zita.
'You are quite in the wrong when you say that
I dagg for you. Lawk-a-biddy! I dagg for you?
On the contrary, it is you who are dagging for
me, and I have to dodge to this side, then to
that, from your gleve, and as I happen to be
sharp of eye and nimble in movement, you do
not catch me. That is how the matter stands,
and not at all as you represent it.'</p>

<p>'Who suffers?' asked Drownlands fiercely.
'Is it you, or is it I? You stand there, composed
and complacent, rubbing up my door-handle
behind your back, and all the while I
am in torture. You cannot speak to me but
you stick a dart; you cannot look at me but I
feel the knife cutting; your very laugh causes a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

wound, and your weapons are all poisoned, and
the gashes fester. Here am I' (he flung the
gleve back into the corner with an oath), 'your
victim, your sport—in suffering.'</p>

<p>He returned to the table.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' said the girl. 'Do not work
yourself into a passion. There's no occasion
for that. Let us come to business.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Drownlands; 'that is the only way
to deal with you. You have a sorry, commercial
mind. Everything to you must be a matter of
pounds, shillings, and pence.'</p>

<p>'That is the only way with me,' said Zita.
'I was brought up to trade, and I love to drive
a bargain. That, if you like it, is sport; it is
sport and business squeezed into one.'</p>

<p>'I will stand here,' said the man. 'You stand
there by the door, if you will; only, I beseech
you, leave off polishing that cursed handle, and
reckoning, as I suppose you are, how many
farthings to charge me for it. As you say that
you love business, to business we will go. As
nothing affects you but what is presented to
your mind in a monetary light, to moneys we
will proceed. We also will have a deal.'</p>

<p>'By all means,' said Zita, with a sigh of relief.
'Now I am on my own ground. Do you want
to buy, sell, or barter?'</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately. He folded
his arms and stood by the window jamb, looking
over his shoulder at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The dusk had set in after the set of sun,
but a silvery grey light suffused the room, the
reflection of the snow on the ground. In this
light he could see Zita. She had withdrawn
her hands from the knob, and had them raised
to her bosom, and was rubbing one palm against
the other leisurely. A fine, clean-built girl.
He also was a fine man, with strongly-cut
features, picturesque, with his long black hair,
his swarthy complexion, his sturdy frame, and
the tiger-skin slung across his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Now I am ready,' said Zita.</p>

<p>He did not speak. He felt that much, everything,
depended on what he said, and how he
said it. His breath came quick, and his brow
was beaded with perspiration.</p>

<p>'You are slow about it,' said Zita. 'Father
took an agency once for an <cite>Illustrated History
of the War</cite>. It was to be in twenty parts, at
half a crown a part, and four beautiful steel
engravings in each, of battles, and generals, and
towns. That <cite>Illustrated War</cite> was such a long
time in progress that some of the subscribers
died, and others moved away, and some went
bankrupt, and there was no getting their money
out of some of the others. Father never would
have anything more to do with concerns that
did not go off smart like the snap of a percussion
cap. It seems to me that this business of
yours is going to be as long and tiresome as
that of the <cite>Illustrated War</cite>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>'You are dagging at me again,' said Drownlands
sullenly.</p>

<p>'I cannot speak a word but it takes you
contrariways,' observed the girl.</p>

<p>He left the window and came to the table,
leaned his hand on it, and stood with his back
to the light. Still unable to make up his mind
to speak, or how to speak, he began to tear
up the blotting-paper into little pieces and to
throw them about, some on the floor, some on
the board. When the last fragment had left
his fingers—</p>

<p>'Zita,' he said in loud and vehement tones, 'I
suppose I am twice your age.'</p>

<p>'I should fancy more than that—a good deal.'</p>

<p>'Be silent and listen to me.' He raised his
voice. 'I am rich. I have a large tract of land—fen-land.
I have turned over every turf, and
under each found gold. But it has not made
me happy. I have had many contradictions,
many sorrows, and some shame. My life has
been blistered and full of running sores. I have
ever been seeking and never finding, till I saw
you. When you came into my house, then I
knew at once that it was you I had craved for
and longed after, and that you, and you alone,
could give me what I can find nowhere else—happiness.'</p>

<p>'Give?' said Zita. 'I thought this was a
business matter.'</p>

<p>'Let me buy my happiness, then, at what

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>

price you desire. I have told you what I am
worth. When I see you, I feel the fire kindles
in my heart; when I do not see you, it smoulders;
and now—now I speak, it breaks out into
raging flames.'</p>

<p>'I must leave this place, or you will go clean
crazy.'</p>

<p>'No, you must not—you shall not leave it!
I could not live without you, having once seen
you. Zita, I must have you!'</p>

<p>'Me?' said Zita. 'With me go the van and
the goods.'</p>

<p>'Curse the van!'</p>

<p>'You must not say that. The van is very
fine, if the poultry would but leave it alone;
and with the curtains and tassels is fit for a
king.'</p>

<p>'Zita, it is you only that I want.'</p>

<p>'There are a lot of goods goes with me—scrubbing-brushes,
mops, brooms, door-mats,
pots and pans. Then there's Jewel—who is not
bad when he does go.'</p>

<p>'You are trifling with me again. Listen to
me. Hear me to the end.'</p>

<p>'I want to hear the end and have done with
it,' said the girl. 'I was reckoning up the
articles. Here's Cheap Jack Zita for one; there
are all these promiscuous goods, that's two;
here's the van, that's three; and there's Jewel,
that's four—a job lot.'</p>

<p>'You are mocking me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>'No indeed, I am not. We are after business,
are we not?'</p>

<p>But Zita was purposely protracting the scene.
She was in difficulties, and was searching to
find a way out of them.</p>

<p>'Yes, business. You are mercantile. Listen
to what I offer. I am rich, a man of consequence,
and a Commissioner. Here is the
house, here is the land. I have money in
the bank—thousands of pounds; all—all I
have is yours; give me but your own self in
return.'</p>

<p>Zita was far from being unfeeling. She was
stirred by the earnestness, the devotion of the
man, but she was not for a moment doubtful
as to what her answer must be. Commercial
though her mind was, she could not accept him
at his price. Her scruple was how to word her
refusal so as least to wound him. In her
peculiar fashion—one inveterate to her—she
twisted the matter about so as to give it a
comical aspect. She saw no other loophole
for escape from a difficult and painful situation.</p>

<p>'I am sorry,' she said, 'that number one in
the job lot is not to be parted with. That is
withdrawn from the sale, or bought in. But if
it is any consolation to you to have the van and
a share of the goods'—</p>

<p>'That is no consolation to me.'</p>

<p>'A queer state of mind to be in—an unwholesome
one, and looks like derangement of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>

intellects. The van ought to comfort any man
with his faculties about him.'</p>

<p>'Zita!' exclaimed Drownlands, striking the
table with his fist, 'you persist in fooling with
me! I will not endure this. I am in deadly
earnest. I know the reason of this trifling.
Mark Runham'—he choked with passion—'Mark
has stepped in, and you have given him
that heart which you deny me—a heart I would
give worlds—worlds'—. He turned to the
window. It was starlight now, starlight over
snowfields. 'Look out, Zita, at the stars. It
is said that they are worlds. If all these were
mine, and filled with unimaginable masses of
treasure, the homes of unexampled happiness,
I would give all for you—all for you—listen to
me—merely that I might call you mine, and
then die.'</p>

<p>'I cannot be yours,' said Zita in a firm voice.
'And now that you have said this, I shall leave
the house.'</p>

<p>'You shall not leave this house!' he cried
fiercely. 'If you attempt it,—if I see that you
are about to attempt it—and I know whither
you would go,—then I will shoot you first, and
myself afterwards.'</p>

<p>'I have to do, then, with a madman?'</p>

<p>'Be it so—with a madman; mad on one
matter only, mad for one thing only—you. I
make no empty threat. I swear by these stars
I will do what I threaten. I cannot and I will

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>

not live without you. I will kill you rather
than that you should belong to another.'</p>

<p>Zita came forward from the door, came to
the table.</p>

<p>'I can never be yours,' she said in a tone as
earnest, as grave as his. 'There is that between
us which makes it for ever impossible.'</p>

<p>'What is the <em>that</em>—Mark Runham?'</p>

<p>'No—not Mark Runham.'</p>

<p>'Who is it, then?'</p>

<p>'There is no <em>who</em>. There is a <em>something</em>.
Must I tell you what it is? I would gladly
spare you.'</p>

<p>'Tell me, and torment me no more.'</p>

<p>She stepped to the corner of the room, took
the flail up, and cast it on the table between
them.</p>

<p>'The <em>something</em> is that flail.'</p>

<p>Suddenly through the window smote a red
flare; it kindled the room, it turned Zita's hair
into a ruddy aureole, it streamed over the table,
and dyed the flail blood-red.</p>

<p>And Drownlands cast himself on his knees,
with a cry of anguish and remorse, and buried
his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Then through the house sounded a hubbub of
voices, and cries for the master.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE FEN RIOTS</p>

<p class="p1">SEVERAL and various causes had combined
to produce discontent in the Fens.</p>

<p>Those who lived by fishing and fowling were
angry because the improved drainage had
destroyed their sporting grounds. Those who
had been left behind in the scramble for land
were discontented because others had seized
the advantageous moment for purchasing which
they had let slip.</p>

<p>The labourers were discontented because of
the lowness of the wage and the high price of
corn. How was it possible for a man on ten
or eleven shillings a week to maintain a family,
when wheat was at four to five shillings a
stone?</p>

<p>It is proverbial that such as have risen from
poverty prove the harshest masters. Such was
the case in the Fens. The landowners were
related by blood and marriage to the labourers
they employed, but, nevertheless, they ground

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>

them under their own heels. A specimen of
their brutality may be instanced. Twice or
thrice the wheat had to be hoed, and the hoers
were women. Over them the farmers set a
ganger armed with an ox goad, who thrust on
the lagging women with a prod between the
shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>The men were paid partly in money, partly
in corn, and were given the refuse wheat that
would not sell, wheat that had been badly
harvested, and had sprouted in the ear, wheat
that made heavy and unwholesome bread.</p>

<p>Labour in the Fens was of a specially trying
nature. The clayer was underground all day
in pits throwing up the marl that was to serve
as manure to the surface earth, and was half
stifled by the noxious exhalations from the
decomposing vegetable matter, and was immersed
half-way up his calves in fetid, phosphorescent
ooze.</p>

<p>The cleaning out and deepening of the dykes
was trying work, for the workman was plunged
to his waist in stagnant water and slime,
tormented by mosquitos, and poisoned by the
stings of the terrible gadfly that threw him into
fever for a fortnight. Everything was poisonous.
The fen-water entering a cut produced gangrene.
If the hand or foot were wounded by a reed,
a sore was the result that resisted healing.</p>

<p>The expenses of the fen-labourer were heavy.
He could not do the tasks set him without a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>

pair of well-tanned leather boots reaching to
the hips, that cost him from thirty-six shillings
to two pounds the pair.</p>

<p>His comforts were small, and were disregarded
by the landowners. His cottage, though quite
modern, was supremely wretched. It had been
run up at the least possible expense, one brick
thick, and one room deep, on piles. But 'the
moor' beneath the surface had shrunk through
the drainage, and the walls gaped, letting wind
and rain drive through the rents, and frost enter,
impossible to expel by the largest fire.</p>

<p>There was then, as there is now, and always
will be, a body of social failures—fraudulent
dealers detected and exposed, but not shamed,
men who, through their sourness of temper, or
indolence, or dishonesty, had failed in whatever
they took in hand. These were ready-made
demagogues, all talkers, all dissatisfied with
every person and thing save themselves,
accusing every institution of corruption, and
every person of injustice, because of their own
incompetence. They were in their element
when real discontent prevailed on account of
real wrongs. They rose into influence as
agitators; they worked on the minds of the
ignorant peasantry, dazzling them with expectations
impossible to be realised, and exciting
them to a frenzy of anger against all who were
in any way their superiors. These men were
rarely sincere in their convictions. They were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

for the most part unscrupulous fishers in troubled
waters. Of the few that were sincere, Ephraim
Beamish was one.</p>

<p>All the elements of dissatisfaction were
combined at the period of our tale, and the
high price of wheat produced an explosion;
but it was Ephraim Beamish who applied the
match.</p>

<p>He had been expelled his office as keeper of
a mill by the Commissioners, and his enforced
idleness gave him leisure to pass from one
centre of discontent to another, to stir up the
embers, fan them to a white heat, and organise
a general outbreak. On a preconcerted day,
the labourers rose, and with them was combined
a large body of men of no particular calling,
who had no particular grievance, and no particular
end in view.</p>

<p>No suspicion of danger was entertained by
the employers, and when the dissatisfied broke
out in open riot, they were taken by surprise
and were unprepared to offer resistance.</p>

<p>Bodies of men assembled at Mildenhall,
Soham, Isleham, Downham, and Littleport, and
the order was given that they were to march
upon Ely, and on their way were to extort from
the farmers promise of higher wage and cheaper
corn. In Ely contributions were to be exacted
from the Bishop, the canons, and all the wealthy
and well-to-do citizens. The mills were to be
wrecked and the banks plundered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>At the head of the whole movement was
Beamish, but he was more especially to act as
commander over the Littleport detachment.</p>

<p>Having got the men together,—the poachers
and wild-duck fowlers armed with their guns,
the labourers with cudgels,—he endeavoured to
marshal them into some sort of discipline and
subjection to orders. But this he found more
difficult than to bring the men together. He
found the men were not amenable to command,
and were indisposed to confine themselves to
exacting contributions. Fortified by their
numbers, they attacked the grocer's shop, the
vicarage, and the home of a retired farmer in
Littleport, broke in the doors and pillaged
them.</p>

<p>Having tasted the pleasures of plunder, they
were prepared to sack and wreck any house
whence they thought liquor or money was to
be got.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Ephraim Beamish
endeavoured to control the unwieldy body of
men. <i>Quot homines, tot sententiæ.</i> And as each
man in the disorderly love-feasts at Corinth
had his prophecy, his psalm, and his interpretation,
so in this assemblage of peasants, each had
his opinion as to where lay the blame for the
distress or discomfort under which he laboured,
each had his private grudge to avenge, each his
special need which he sought to satisfy, and
all were united in equal determination not to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

submit to dictation from Beamish or any other
man.</p>

<p>The tavern at Littleport could hardly escape,
although it had been a rendezvous of the dissatisfied.
The mob rushed towards it to break
in and seize on the contents of the cellar. In
vain did Beamish protest that they were injuring
a good cause by their disorderly conduct; all
desired drink, and none paid heed to his remonstrance.</p>

<p>The taverner barely averted having his house
looted by rolling a hogshead of ale out of his
doors, and bidding the rioters help themselves.</p>

<p>Then Beamish sprang on a bench and entreated
the men to attend to what he had
to say.</p>

<p>'We want no words,' said one of the rioters.
'We are dry, we want drink. We've empty
pockets, and want to fill them. Our ears have
been stuffed with words. Keep them for chapel
on Sundays.'</p>

<p>'I will speak,' cried Beamish. 'I am your
leader. You have sworn to follow and obey
me. You elected me yourselves.'</p>

<p>'Lead us to liquor and sovereigns, and we'll
follow sharp enough.'</p>

<p>'You are wasting time. You are damaging
a righteous cause. Have we not to march to
Ely? Have we not to visit the farmers on the
way, and impose our terms there?'</p>

<p>'There's plenty of time for that, Pip.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>'There is not plenty of time. The Mildenhall
men are on their way under Cutman, five hundred
strong.'</p>

<p>'How do you know that?'</p>

<p>'It was so planned. The Isleham men are
marching under Goat, the Soham men under
Gotobed. Who will be first in Ely? Is Littleport,
that should lead the way, to come in at
the tail?'</p>

<p>'There is something in that, mates,' shouted
one of the rioters. 'Stand in order, you chaps.
To Ely! Bring along the waggon.'</p>

<p>The idea that, if looting were to be done,
they of Littleport might come in merely to glean
where others had reaped, and the consciousness
that a far richer harvest was awaiting them in
Ely than could be garnered in Littleport, acted
as a stimulus, and the mob desisted from
further violence, and roughly organised itself
into marching order. All were armed after a
fashion, with guns, pitchforks, cudgels, leaping-poles,
and cleavers; and as the day was
declining, there was a cry for torches.</p>

<p>'We shan't want them,' called one of the men.
'We'll light bonfires on our way.'</p>

<p>Then a waggon was drawn out. In it were
stationed some fowlers with duck-guns. The
object of the waggon was to serve as a sort of
fortress. Those in it were above the heads of
the rest, and, in the event of resistance or an
attack, could fire over their heads. Moreover,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>

the waggon would be serviceable to carry the
spoil taken on the way, or gathered in Ely.</p>

<p>Then the mob rolled along the great drove
or highway to the city, with shouts, and oaths,
and laughter, and trampled the snow as it
advanced, leaving a black slush behind it.</p>

<p>Many of the men were half intoxicated with
the ale and spirits they had already imbibed,
and all were wholly drunk with lust of gain and
love of destruction.</p>

<p>Then one in the waggon shouted, 'To Crumbland!'
Another shouted, 'No, no! Young
Runham is not bad. He has sold his wheat
cheap and thrashed out all his stacks. And
the old woman is a widow.'</p>

<p>'That's nought,' exclaimed a third, 'if there's
any liquor to be had there!'</p>

<p>'To Gaultrip's!' was the cry.</p>

<p>'Gaultrip is my cousin!' shouted another.</p>

<p>'That's nought,' called one of the mob. 'I
suppose he has money.'</p>

<p>'Ely way!' roared Beamish, scrambling into
the waggon. 'Drive ahead. What's the use of
being the commander, if nobody listens to the
word of command, and nobody thinks of obeying
it, if he does hear it?'</p>

<p class="center">TWENTY POUNDS</p>

<p class="p1">THE shrill voice of Mrs. Tunkiss was heard,
as she ran screaming up the stairs, calling
for 'the master.' Then she burst into his room,
followed by the maid-of-all-work, who was in
convulsive jerks.</p>

<p>'Oh, master! there is a riot. Some of our
men have joined, and there is a stack on fire
at Gaultrip's. The mob is coming here, and
threatens to burn us.'</p>

<p>'Who are coming?' asked Drownlands,
looking up. He staggered to his feet, but was
as one dazed. He did not observe the glare in
the room. He did not hear distinctly the words
spoken.</p>

<p>'Look, master! look at the blaze. It is at
Gaultrip's. You can hear them coming on.
They are swearing horrible, and say they will
have our lives.'</p>

<p>'What is this all about?'</p>

<p>'I don't know for certain. Tom Easy has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>

run here afore to tell us what he has gathered.
But lawk! poor lad, he's frightened; and me—my
poor head won't hold it. He says the mob
be armed with bombs and cannons, and all sorts
of engines of war, and they'll blow us up into
the skies.'</p>

<p>Drownlands passed his hand over his eyes,
then went to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>He saw in the distance the red blaze of a
burning rick, the flames dancing and leaping in
the air, and carrying with them wisps of ignited
straw, which were borne on the wind as firebrands,
to carry destruction elsewhere. He
could see the mob advancing as a ripple of fire
running along the drove before a dark wave.
The rioters had, in fact, twisted up bands of
straw, had lighted them, and were waving them
as torches as they advanced, and the flames
were reflected in the dykes on each side of the
road. Drownlands was surprised. He threw up
the sash, and the roar of voices was carried into
the room.</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this?' asked he.
'Who are these that are coming this way?'</p>

<p>'It is the rioters,' answered Mrs. Tunkiss.</p>

<p>'Rioters? What rioters?'</p>

<p>'Lawk! how can I tell? Tom Easy said
they want advance of wages, and cheap flour.
And he said, they ask for money to help on the
cause.'</p>

<p>'Cause? What cause?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>'Lawk, sir! how can I say? Tom Easy said
it was the Union of Fen Labourers, and they
will have blood or money. They will make you
swear to pay them two shillings a-day more
wage, and pull the price of flour down to half
a crown.'</p>

<p>'They demand money of me, do they? Let
them venture to require it of me.'</p>

<p>'Here they are!' screamed Mrs. Tunkiss, as
a blow was levelled at the door, and the strokes
resounded through the house.</p>

<p>'Who was that?' shouted Drownlands from
the window, with a curse. He was not a man
to spare oaths when he was angry. 'Who
struck my door? I will have the law of him.'</p>

<p>The mob was pouring into the yard.</p>

<p>'Make a blaze, and let us see the old tiger!'
shouted one of the rioters, and bunches of straw
and corn were snatched from a rick, a blaze was
made, and fire tossed about, illumining the
face of the house and the figures of the men in
the waggon.</p>

<p>'By heaven, I know you!' shouted Drownlands
from the window. 'That is Aaron Chevell
in the waggon, and by him Isaac Harley and
Harry Tansley with guns. I'll not forget you.
I have a memory. I have five ash trees on the
drove side, and I shall have a rioter slung to
every branch of every tree, and shall begin with
my own workmen.'</p>

<p>'Hold a civil tongue in your head!' shouted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

Chevell from the waggon. 'Don't threaten
what you can't perform. We have guns here, as
you see, and can silence you; and we shan't
think twice about doing so, if you do not come
to our terms.'</p>

<p>'Master Drownlands!' called Ephraim Beamish,
working his way forward in the waggon
with his long arms, and leaning his elbows on
the front board when he had thrust himself into
the middle position, 'you will gain nothing by
abuse and threats. We have a good cause, and
are a thousand strong to support it. You have
had everything in the Fens your own way too
long, and have trampled the working men under
foot. You have coined their sweat into silver'—</p>

<p>Some one shouted as a correction, 'Into gold.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Beamish; 'you have coined the
sweat of your men into heavy gold, and have
left the men to hunger, and toil, and nakedness;
to cramp, and ague, and fever. They have
their rights as well as you. They have borne
their wrongs long enough. Now they have
risen to demand what in equity is theirs—some
share of the profits, some just proportion out of
your gains, so that they may live in comfort, and
not barely live.'</p>

<p>'Shut your mouth!' roared one of the crowd;
'we want no preaching now. We knows our
rights, and we'll maintain them with our fists,
and not with your tongue. Pip thinks he'll
convert Tiger Ki, he does! Words won't do

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>

that. Send a shot at him, Tansley. That's the
only argument for him.'</p>

<p>Tansley, the man addressed, thrust Beamish
back with the butt-end of his fowling-piece, and
laid his barrel on the front board.</p>

<p>'Listen, Master Drownlands,' shouted Beamish,
again making an effort to shoulder his way to
the front of the waggon. 'What we ask of you
is twenty pounds for the cause of the United Fen
Labourers. Give us twenty pounds, and swear
to the conditions—a fair wage and cheap corn.
Then we will do you no harm whatever. We
will take your money, and move along our way.
We are bound for Ely.'</p>

<p>'I pay you twenty pounds?' yelled Drownlands.
'I have a gun as well as you have, and
will contribute lead to the cause—lead only.'</p>

<p>He ran to the corner of the room and took
down his gun from the rack.</p>

<p>'I'll shoot,' threatened Tansley.</p>

<p>'Ay—and so will I,' said Drownlands, 'and
let us see who can take the best aim. I think
my eye is pretty well known to be sharp and
my hand steady. By the Lord, I'll not spare
you!' He paused and put on a hat. 'I can
see finely with all those wisps of fire. Hold up
your torches, boys, higher, that I may send my
bullet into Tansley's heart. He will leap, and
then down he goes.'</p>

<p>Fallen pieces of ignited straw had kindled the
half-kneaded straw on the ground, and there

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>

ran flames and half-flames to and fro on the soil.
The cart-horses in the waggon started and shifted
position to escape these flashes and flickers.</p>

<p>'Drownlands!' shouted a young voice, and
Mark Runham thrust his way through the
crowd. 'I pray you be reasonable. You will
provoke bloodshed.'</p>

<p>'What, you there? You a ringleader in riots?'
exclaimed Drownlands, lowering his fowling-piece.</p>

<p>'I am not that. Let me come within.'</p>

<p>Then Mark stood on the waggon-shafts and
called to the crowd—</p>

<p>'Refrain from violence! Leave me to
manage Master Drownlands. I will engage
him to let you have the money you require.'</p>

<p>Then he jumped down from the shafts and
ran up the steps.</p>

<p>The door had been bolted and chained by the
housekeeper, but Zita, hearing what Mark said,
without waiting for orders, descended to the
ground floor, and unbarred the door, and
admitted him. He ran upstairs, for no time
was to be lost. The mob was restless and
irritated. It was impatient to be on its way to
Ely, and yet was reluctant to leave Prickwillow
without having drawn money from it, or done
some mischief.</p>

<p>Drownlands was too angry to listen to advice.
He would not hear of coming to terms with the
rabble. He had been too long accustomed to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

domineer over the labourers to fear them now.
He in no way realised how much courage is
given by association in numbers.</p>

<p>'What are you here for? How dare you
enter uninvited?' he exclaimed, as Mark came
into the office, followed by Zita.</p>

<p>'I admitted him,' said the girl. 'He has
come in your interest.'</p>

<p>'He is one of the rioters! He is a leader!
A Runham of Crumbland, with a tail of dirty
scoundrels after him, burning, pillaging, and
getting drunk.'</p>

<p>'I beseech you,' said Mark—'I entreat you
to listen to reason. The men are, as you say,
drunk—drunk with folly. I am no leader.'</p>

<p>'You are acting for them.'</p>

<p>'I am an intermediary. They have spared
me. They came to Crumbland, but we
humoured them, brought out cake and ale,
and they went their way without molestation.
Gaultrip resisted, and they set fire to a stack,
and so frightened him that he yielded, and paid
fifteen pounds. Now he is engaged in saving
his other stacks. Do not provoke these fellows
further.'</p>

<p>'I will not listen to you. You ought to be
ashamed to take the part of these scurvy
ragamuffins.'</p>

<p>'I am not taking their part, but yours.
Hark!'</p>

<p>There was a cry from the yard of, 'Drownlands!

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>

Tiger Ki! We will break in the house
door unless you give us money.'</p>

<p>Then a brick was thrown. It crashed through
the double panes of the window with raised sash,
and fell in the room, accompanied by a shower
of glass splinters.</p>

<p>'I will shoot one of them!' exclaimed the
yeoman, and he ran with his gun to the window.</p>

<p>Mark had just time to strike up the barrel,
and the contents were discharged in the air,
hurting nobody.</p>

<p>Drownlands turned on him with an oath.</p>

<p>'I will punish you,' he said, stamping with
fury, and he rushed upon Mark with his gun
raised over his head, grasping it by the barrel.</p>

<p>Then Zita sprang between them, holding the
flail in both her hands, as a ward against the stock.</p>

<p>'Stand back, Mark!' she cried. 'He dare not
touch you across this flail.'</p>

<p>It was as she said.</p>

<p>The man stood as one paralysed, the uplifted
gun in his hands, his eyes glaring at young
Runham, and the red reflections of the fire
flashing on his face and turning it to blood.
But the blow did not fall. His muscles remained
immovable, the gun suspended in the air, till
Zita lowered the flail, and put it behind her back.
Then the spell was off him. He let the gun fall
on the ground, and his head sank on his bosom.</p>

<p>The discharge of the fowling-piece had produced
a hush in the voices outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>None knew whether, in the darkness, some
one had been hit. But when, after a pause, it
was found that no harm had been done, then
there broke forth loud cries and execrations; the
courage of the rabble rose with a sense of its
immunity, and a rain of brickbats beat against
the windows of the house, shivering the panes.
The kitchen-maid fell on the floor in a fit. Mrs.
Tunkiss went into a series of shrieks. Renewed
blows were raised against the house door, and
they were accompanied with cries of, 'Smash it
in! Tear the tiger's house down! He has
hundreds of pounds put away somewhere. If
he will not pay twenty sovereigns when we ask
civil, we will take two hundred.'</p>

<p>Then one shrill voice cried, 'Make a bonfire
of the wheat ricks.'</p>

<p>'Ki Drownlands! will you do nothing?'
asked Mark; 'will you not give up a few pounds
to save those long ranges of stacks?'</p>

<p>'Let them do their worst,' answered the
master of Prickwillow doggedly. 'By the
light of the fire I will note every face, and mark
them all down, man by man, and then woe
betide them.'</p>

<p>Then a burst of cheers, and cries of, 'That
will do famously. We will have that out. Get
horses, harness, and we will drive to Ely.'</p>

<p>Zita ran to the window, and returned hastily
with a blank face.</p>

<p>'They have found my van! They have got inside.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>

They are clambering on the roof. They are
treating it worse than poultry! Oh, Mark! Mark!'</p>

<p>Then through the window she pleaded, 'Spare
my van. Here are ten gold sovereigns.' Then to
Mark, 'Take my money, go to the men, and get
them to leave my darling, precious van alone.'</p>

<p>'Stay,' said Drownlands. 'I have changed
my mind.' He went to the door and summoned
the domestics who had fled when the brickbat
crashed into the room. 'Come here, Leehanna.
Sarah, get out of your fits and come at once.
Come here, Tom Easy.'</p>

<p>The frightened servants obeyed.</p>

<p>'Bring a candle,' he said.</p>

<p>The scared housekeeper did as required.</p>

<p>When Drownlands had received the light, he
went into the passage, and, holding it before the
face of Mark, said to the domestics, 'Do you
know who this is? Is not this Mark Runham?
Can you swear to it?' He paused for an answer
to each question.</p>

<p>'He has come here, pushed his way into
my house, against my wishes, to force me to
contribute twenty pounds towards the cause of
the rioters. He threatens me with the burning
of my ricks if I do not comply. Is it not so?'</p>

<p>'I have come,' said Mark, 'because I am
desirous to save you, as well as others in your
house, from injury; and also to intervene and
protect these misguided men against committing
a crime.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>'They touched nothing at Crumbland.'</p>

<p>'No; we gave them food and drink.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you are hand and glove with them.
And now you are acting as their spokesman and
their leader. Take my money—twenty pounds,
and take Zita's ten pounds—thirty pounds in
all, the plunder of this house. Mind you, I give
it on compulsion. I do not find meat and
liquor for the rioters; I do this to save my ricks
of corn. And I give it to you, Mark Runham,
acting for the rioters.'</p>

<p>Drownlands turned to those present.</p>

<p>'I call upon you all to witness, you, Leehanna
Tunkiss, you, Sarah, you, Tom Easy, and you,
Zita, that I pay over my twenty pounds against
my will. Open your hand, Mark Runham. Let
them see that you have there my twenty pounds
and Zita's ten pounds. There are the sovereigns
all in gold. They are well spent—well spent—they
rid me of you.'</p>

<p>A few moments later a shout rang from the
crowd without—'Tiger Ki has shelled out. For
the Union, for the Cause! for the fen-labourers!
Twenty pounds! Twenty pounds for liberty and
right! The cheap loaf and the big wage!
Hurrah! hurrah, boys! Forward to Ely! On
to the banks. On to the mills!'</p>

<p>Drownlands looked after the retreating mob
from his window, and said, with a sneer, 'Go on—to
the gallows, Mark Runham; I am clear of
you now. Cheap at twenty pounds.'</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TEN POUNDS</p>

<p class="p1">NOTWITHSTANDING the call of 'On
to Ely!' the mob was not at once in
motion. Something delayed it.</p>

<p>Zita went to the window and looked out.
She saw that which excited and angered her,
and, turning her head to Drownlands, said—</p>

<p>'It is a shame! It is disgraceful! They have
taken my ten pounds, and yet they are carrying
off my van. They have put Jewel into the
shafts. They might as well have harnessed the
Archbishop! He's stiffening his legs and setting
back his ears. Look how he's cocking his tail.
They will have to drag on van and Jewel
together. What a thing the general public is!
I never knew it in this mood before, and yet I
thought I knew it pretty well. I'll clear the
public out of my van. There are a dozen inside,
and a score on the roof. They have no right to
do this after accepting my money.'</p>

<p>She left the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>'Zita, where are you going?' asked Drownlands.</p>

<p>'Going to send the general public skipping,'
she answered.</p>

<p>'You cannot do it. It is not safe to leave the
house.'</p>

<p>'Trust me. I've swept the poultry off, and
I'm not afraid of the public. I know how to
deal with them as I do with fowls.'</p>

<p>Before Drownlands had time to offer further
remonstrance, she had darted out of the office,
run to her own room, taken a pair of fencing
foils from the stores, had descended the stairs
two steps at a time, had unbarred the door and
was out in the yard, making for the van.</p>

<p>'Stand still—don't move,' she said to Jewel,
as she passed his head; and he turned one of
his eyes at her and winked.</p>

<p>'Clear away at once,' she shouted to those
around the van. 'You have taken my money,
and must let the conveyance alone.'</p>

<p>'Who are you? We've no money of yours.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you have. I sent out ten pounds to you.
Go, ask your commander, secretary, treasurer, or
whatever you call him. He has pocketed my
ten pounds, and you are bound to leave my van
alone. I am the Cheap Jack girl.'</p>

<p>'Are you the daughter of the Cheap Jack who
died here?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am; and this is my van. Hands off.
You have no quarrel against me. What have I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>

done to make bread dear and keep wages low?
I do not belong to these parts. Stand aside.'</p>

<p>She thrust her way to the back of the van
where was the glass door. This had been
opened, and several men had ensconced themselves
inside on the benches.</p>

<p>Zita entered, a foil in each hand. Within it
was dark, but she nevertheless knew that the
interior was packed full of men.</p>

<p>'This is my conveyance,' she said imperiously;
'you have no more right to enter it than you
have to occupy the house of the Lord Mayor.
I have got a sword in each hand. I cannot see
any one in the dark, but I will dagg with each
hand, as you dagg for eels, and I will go on
dagging till I have got a man wriggling at the
end of each.'</p>

<p>Down went the front of the van, and out
tumbled a dozen lusty men, one over another,
stumbling, falling, sprawling, in the trampled
snow and straw.</p>

<p>Zita went through the van from aft to fore,
and satisfied herself that it was cleared of its
human occupants. Then, standing on the platform,
which had been thrown forward by those
who burst away from her foils, she looked up at
the roof. A score of men and youths was on it,
their legs pendent.</p>

<p>'Down with you at once,' she said. 'Do you
see these rapiers? Do you think I can't run a
man through as easy as stick a needle in a pin-cushion?

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

It's not the running in—it's the pulling
out is the trouble. There's a button at the end
of each blade. I have got only two—so I can
pin but two of you, and that shall be the last
two that leave the roof.'</p>

<p>She made as though about to scramble on to
the top of the van, and away went the men
seated there, dropping like ripe pears from a
tree.</p>

<p>Zita leisurely reclosed the front of the van,
and went out at the back and shut that door
also.</p>

<p>'That's a good job done, Jewel,' said she.
'Now run the van backwards into the shed, and
you shall return to the stable. Roman candles,
Jewel—pop-bang! Roman candles at your
nose.'</p>

<p>'Hold there, you Cheap Jack girl!' shouted a
broad-shouldered man, coming up and laying
his hand on the bit. 'We have taken this conveyance
for the Union. It is confiscated.'</p>

<p>'Whether taken and confiscated I cannot say,'
said Zita. 'But I know I have paid ten pounds
to have it untaken and set at liberty. Return
my ten sovereigns if you take from me my van.'</p>

<p>'We have no ten sovereigns of yours.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you have. And a shame it is that you
should rob a poor Cheap Jack girl. Not that
she belongs to the general public, save and
deliver us!—but she is a working girl, and poor.'</p>

<p>'We have had no money of yours, and we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>

requisition the van. We want to load it in Ely.
It will serve our purpose better than a waggon.'</p>

<p>'You shall not have it,' replied Zita. 'Fair
trade is fair trade, and he that will not deal
honourably I will run through, and leave the
button sticking between his shoulders, and that
will spoil a good weskit.'</p>

<p>The man sprang back as she threatened him
with one of the foils.</p>

<p>'I will tell you what it is,' said Zita; 'you
will not believe me till I have made an example
of one of you.'</p>

<p>'Where is your ten pounds?' asked Pip
Beamish, who had descended from the waggon.</p>

<p>'Ay,' said several of those who stood round;
'that is what we should uncommon like to
know.'</p>

<p>'Where are my ten pounds?' repeated Zita.
'That is a fine question for you to put to me,
when I'll be bound you have them in your
pocket.'</p>

<p>'Bring them out, Pip!' called one of the men.</p>

<p>'I have not got her money. I have not
touched it,' protested the commander.</p>

<p>'I gave it to Mark Runham along with the
master's twenty pounds.'</p>

<p>'The twenty pounds has been put into the
Union box—I never touched your ten.'</p>

<p>'Come, come, Pip,' said a cluster of men,
'no shuffling. Mark wouldn't have held back
the money. You have had it, sure enough.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>'I have not had one farthing of it.'</p>

<p>'I paid ten pounds to have my van set at
liberty. I did not wish to have it sat upon,
and the sides kicked, and the varnish scratched.
I gave ten pounds to save it from that.'</p>

<p>'What did you get, Beamish?' asked Aaron
Chevell.</p>

<p>'I got just twenty pounds and no more—the
twenty pounds that Drownlands contributed,
and that I put into the box with the rest.'</p>

<p>'And not my ten?' exclaimed Zita. 'That
is a falsehood. My ten was with his twenty.
Thirty pounds in all, in gold.'</p>

<p>'There has been cheating,' shouted two or
three.</p>

<p>'That is what comes of jaw and preaching.'</p>

<p>'Mates,' said Aaron Chevell, 'we must not
let this pass. Let us have judge and jury
There has been robbery of the common fund.
Mates, I vote that we arrest Pip Beamish, and
try him at once.'</p>

<p>'Have him up in the cart,' said Tansley.
'Comrades all! light some more straw wisps.
There has been a case of roguery. There has
been our chief officer taking the money that was
contributed to the Union, and pocketing it for
his private use. I charge Ephraim Beamish,
and vote that he be deposed from his command,
and be tried for felony.'</p>

<p>'I second it,' shouted Isaac Harley. 'And
what I say is—like enough. He who wants

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

most has taken it. A chap as hasn't a house to
call his home, nor an honest employ in which to
earn his living.'</p>

<p>'It is not what I calls respectable,' said one
man, 'that we should march under such a rascal.'</p>

<p>Then ensued a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>'Up into the waggon with him, and try him
there.'</p>

<p>In vain did Beamish protest that he had not
defrauded the Union, that he had received no
more than twenty pounds. The rest suspected
him, and were jealous of his assumption of
authority.</p>

<p>'You Cheap Jack girl,' called Chevell, 'we
want your evidence. Ay, bring the swords along
with you, if you're afraid of us, but we do not
hurt women.'</p>

<p>Zita allowed herself to be conducted to the
waggon, and assisted into it with rough courtesy.</p>

<p>A fen-farm waggon is a very massive structure,
more massive, perhaps, than one in other parts
of England. It has its peculiarity, which consists
in the front board being unusually high
and arched at top. Often may women be seen
going to market in the waggons, crouching
against this high board, which screens them
from the wind.</p>

<p>There is much vermilion paint employed on
the waggons, and the front board usually blazes
with colour. It was so on this occasion. The
waggon carried off by the rioters had recently

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>

been painted, and the vermilion was of the
brightest.</p>

<p>Isaac Harley cried from his place in the
waggon, 'Mates, who is to be judge?'</p>

<p>'We will have no judge but ourselves,' was the
ready response.</p>

<p>'Then,' cried Tansley, 'choose your jury.'</p>

<p>'We will all be jury!' shouted the mob.</p>

<p>Then Aaron Chevell, standing forward, said,
'Comrades, the case is this. This young gal—she
is the Cheap Jack's lass, staying here—says
she gave ten sovereigns in gold to the labourers'
cause, to have her van let alone. And she gave
it along with the twenty pounds of Tiger Ki.
Now we want to know what has become of this
contribution of hers. Ephraim Beamish swears
he never received it.'</p>

<p>'I had the twenty pounds of Mark Runham,'
said Beamish, 'but not ten besides.'</p>

<p>'You stand by the front board,' said Chevell
to Zita, 'and tell your story. We will hold
Beamish, and every one shall judge.'</p>

<p>'What? the general public?' asked Zita,
looking round at the crowd of upturned faces.</p>

<p>'Yes; it shall give judgment.'</p>

<p>'Then you'll have rare judgment,' said Zita.
She went forward to the place pointed out to
her, and stood there, with her back to the scarlet
board, and leaned on her foils. Blazing straw
wisps were held up, brilliantly illumining the
whole scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>'I call to silence,' said Chevell, 'and let us
hear what the Cheap Jack gal has to say.'</p>

<p>'What I have to say is this,' said Zita. 'I
saw that you had drawn out my van, the house
in which I was born and reared, the shop
whence all our profits came, and were treating
it worse than did the poultry. So I gave my
savings to Mark Runham, ten pounds, all I had
on me in gold, at the same time that the master
gave twenty pounds to save his corn-stacks.
Mark Runham took it to the man, Pip Beamish,
who is your captain.'</p>

<p>'No, he ain't! we have deposed him!' was
shouted on all sides.</p>

<p>Then voices were raised for Runham, but
Mark was not to be found.</p>

<p>'We want another witness,' said Chevell.</p>

<p>'There is one,' said Zita, pointing with a foil
to Drownlands at the window of his office.
'There are more if you desire them—Leehanna
Tunkiss, the girl Sarah, and Tom Easy. They
all saw me give Mark the money.'</p>

<p>Aaron called to Drownlands if it was so.
Drownlands answered in assent.</p>

<p>'Summon the other witnesses,' commanded
the self-constituted judge.</p>

<p>Whilst the men knocked at the house door
and demanded the presence of Mrs. Tunkiss
and the girl Sarah, Beamish raised his voice in
protest.</p>

<p>'I say, mates and comrades all, this is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>

strange and unwarranted proceedings. Am not
I your leader?'</p>

<p>A shout of, 'You was—but you're a thief—we'll
have none of you. I vote for Aaron
Chevell. Duck him; he's a turncoat. He's a
cheat and robs the poor men.'</p>

<p>'It is false!' shouted Beamish, between rage
and disappointment. 'How can I have acted
as you say, when I am the man who urged you
on,—I, who have the cause at heart more than
any of you?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! that's how Judas talked!' shouted
some one in the crowd. Then there came
yells of, 'Judas! Judas! Let him hang like
Judas!'</p>

<p>The door of the house was not opened to
allow the witnesses to issue at the dictate of the
mob.</p>

<p>'We must have more witnesses,' said Chevell.
'We don't lay much store on Drownlands. He
ain't taken the oath.'</p>

<p>Then Zita appealed to the master of Prickwillow
to suffer the maids to come forth. After
some hesitation he agreed.</p>

<p>'I'll let 'em out if you'll hang Beamish,'
shouted he from the window.</p>

<p>Presently the door of the house was cautiously
opened, and Drownlands, who stood at it, thrust
forth the two women. Mrs. Tunkiss was white
and quaking; Sarah nigh upon a fit.</p>

<p>'Now, then,' demanded the judge, 'up into

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>

the waggon wi' you. And, lads, hold up the
torches that I may see if they looks honest and
truthful. You—Leehanna Tunkiss—did this
Cheap Jack girl give ten pounds for us into
the hands of Beamish?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! forty!' exclaimed the woman, who
did not understand what was being done, and
thought she might be incriminating Zita, or
doing her some harm by the admission.</p>

<p>'She don't quite agree about the figure,—she
says forty,—but she establishes the fact,' said
Chevell, addressing the crowd. 'You swear to
it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I swear!' exclaimed Mrs. Tunkiss. 'Oh,
gentlemen, let me down! I shall faint.'</p>

<p>'Pass her down,' ordered Aaron. 'Now you
other—Sarah Gathercole—did she give him
money? She shakes her head—I mean she
nods.'</p>

<p>'She has the Vitus' dance,' protested the
accused.</p>

<p>'She understands what's she's axed—eh?'</p>

<p>The poor girl nodded in her nervous fit.</p>

<p>'And you swear to it—the Cheap Jack girl
gave ten pounds?'</p>

<p>Again she went into fits of jerking and
nodding.</p>

<p>'She's mighty sure of it, that she be,' said
Aaron. 'What say you, mates and chums? Is
it proved?'</p>

<p>A roar in response, in the affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now then,' said Chevell, 'it is for Pip
Beamish to answer in his defence.'</p>

<p>'I never had more than twenty pounds.
Search me if you will.'</p>

<p>'You may have been too sharp for that,' said
Isaac Harley. 'Mates, he ain't got a defence.
I vote for condemnation. This Pip Beamish
has been terribly stuck up, and has given himself
the airs of a dook, and has been ordering
us about. I vote that he is a thieving rascal.
What say you?'</p>

<p>'Hear! hear! We say the same!' Then
ensued shouts of, 'Kick him down! Duck
him! Chuck him into the Lark!'</p>

<p>In a moment Beamish was plucked out of
the waggon, flapping his long arms in protest
and entreaty, was jostled, beaten, kicked, and
finally thrown into the dyke—the one honest
and sincere man among the leaders of the
rabble.</p>

<p>'Now then, mates,' called Chevell, 'it is right
and proper that we should elect another commander.'</p>

<p>'We want no commanders!' shouted the mob.
'We know what we want! We will all be
commanders! Are we not the general public?'</p>

<p>'Then I vote,' cried Harley, 'that we lose no
more time, but move on to Ely.'</p>

<p>Zita was helped out of the cart. The improvised
torches were set in motion, forming a
line of fire as the whole mob of rioters left the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>

farm, and marched along the dark embankment,
whilst the waggon bounced below on the drove.</p>

<p>As Zita stood by the van, which she had
thrust back with the aid of Jewel into the shed,
a hand was laid on hers.</p>

<p>'Zita!'</p>

<p>The voice was that of Mark.</p>

<p>'Oh, Mark!'</p>

<p>'Zita, here are your ten pounds. I did not
give them to Beamish.'</p>

<p>'Mark! and he has been deposed, and cuffed
and beaten, for having stolen it.'</p>

<p>'He has been thrown into the dyke, and I
have helped him out of the water. Do not be
disconcerted. I could not have done him a
better turn than this, to get him out of association
with men who are running their heads
into hangmen's nooses.'</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A NEW DANGER</p>

<p class="p1">'MARK, how was it that you did not give
them my ten pounds?'</p>

<p>'Why, my dear Zita, I thought I could get
them off without it. I gave them Drownlands'
twenty. He escaped cheap at that price, and
twenty pounds is nothing to him. I made sure
I could induce them to leave your van alone
without payment to do so, and when I saw
them harness Jewel to it, then I was quite
certain they would have to leave it; you do not
suppose I would have suffered those rascals to
take your money except in an extremity? To
rob you was to rob me, Zit—for I never would
have suffered you to lose those ten pounds. If
I had been constrained to give them up, I would
have refunded this sum to you out of my own
pocket.'</p>

<p>'You are very good.'</p>

<p>'Not at all. I have more money than I know
how to spend.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>'You are good all round. You pulled Pip
Beamish out of the water, and I know you do
not love him.'</p>

<p>'You see I help one I love, and one I do not
love.'</p>

<p>Zita coloured. 'I did not mean that.'</p>

<p>'Then I do,'said Mark roguishly. 'You are
in the right in this, that I do not love Beamish,—for
one thing, because I think him a perverse,
meddlesome, mischievous, discontented donkey,
and for another, because of Kainie.'</p>

<p>'Kainie again?' exclaimed Zita, drawing
back.</p>

<p>'Yes, because I do not choose to have him
running after her.'</p>

<p>'Why should he not run after her as well as
you?'</p>

<p>'Because he can never make her happy.'</p>

<p>'And you can?'</p>

<p>'I can try,' said Mark.</p>

<p>'Well, that is frank!' said Zita, huffed. 'You
called me "Dear Zita," just now—I suppose it
is "Dear Kainie" as well.'</p>

<p>'My dear Zita'—</p>

<p>'Perhaps you will keep your "dears" for her,
or any one else who cares to have them and
share them with others. I do not wish to be
so termed. I refuse to be so called.'</p>

<p>She turned to leave. He caught her by the
arm.</p>

<p>'Do not be cross. I cannot explain matters

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>

now. It is all right. I did not mean to offend
you.'</p>

<p>But Zita would not speak. She hastened to
the house with pouting lips, burning cheeks,
and sunken eyes. As she entered, she encountered
Drownlands, in his slouched hat, and
wearing a long great-coat in place of his usual
tiger-skin. He held a whip in his hand, and
had a pistol sticking out of his breast pocket.</p>

<p>'Are you going out?' asked the girl.</p>

<p>'Yes. You are in no further danger. The
rabble will not return. I shall follow them.'</p>

<p>'Why so?'</p>

<p>'To bring all I can to the gallows. I shall
watch every man I know, and see what his
proceedings are. I shall take account of every
act of lawlessness. They have not had my
twenty pounds for nothing. I shall get some
satisfaction in return. In Ely folks will be too
much alarmed, the faces will be too strange for
there to be recognition of offenders. That is
my work. I shall witness against them, man
by man, beginning with my own labourers who
have revolted against me. I have purchased
the right with my twenty pounds—a life for
every pound—ha! ha!'</p>

<p>Then, looking steadily into Zita's eyes, he
said in a low, bitter tone, 'I shall begin with
Mark Runham.'</p>

<p>'Mark?' echoed the girl. 'He has done no
harm.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>'Has he not? He entered my house uninvited.
He acted for the rioters. He was their
mouthpiece. He extorted money from me for
them.'</p>

<p>He struck his boot with his whip, strode
faster, then turned on the doorstep and said,
'If not the gallows for Mark, then transportation.
I am well rid of him. See what it is for
a man to venture himself in my way.'</p>

<p>Zita was startled. What had Mark done to
incur the penalties of the law? Was it conceivable
that Drownlands was in earnest? He
made idle menaces. He had threatened to
string the rioters to every bough of his five ash
trees. He had not done it, and he could not
do it. His present menace was as empty.</p>

<p>She watched the master ride forth from the
stable when he had saddled his horse himself.
No man was left on the premises to attend on
him. The boy, Tom Easy, was too frightened
to be of service, and Drownlands was impatient
to be off.</p>

<p>As the farmer rode past the door, he turned
his face towards Zita, but in the darkness she
could not see its expression.</p>

<p>He pointed in the direction of Ely with his
whip, and at that moment Zita heard a roar of
voices, followed by an explosion of firearms
borne upon the wind. In fact, the rioters had
reached the metropolis of the Fens. They had
let the waggon precede the marching body.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>

The front board had been notched to receive
the fowling-pieces, and the insurgent labourers,
on reaching the main street, had announced
their entry by a discharge of firearms and a
ringing shout, calculated to strike terror into
the hearts of the citizens.</p>

<p>Zita did not remain long inactive, listening to
the sounds of uproar in the distance.</p>

<p>'Sharp! a pail!' she called to the quaking
kitchen-maid. 'There is no reason why you
should be idle, or I either, because a parcel of
men are making fools of themselves.'</p>

<p>'A pail? What can you want a pail for at
such a time as this?' asked Mrs. Tunkiss.
'You ought to be down on your knees praying.'</p>

<p>'You would want a pail, and soap, and water,
and a scrubbing-brush, Leehanna, if you had
been drawn out into the yard, and had had a
score of bumpkins sitting on your back and
kicking your sides with their dirty boots. I am
not going to let my van remain all night in its
present condition, to have the clay caked over
it in the morning, just because wheat is up and
wages down, and folks don't like to have it so.
I will clean the van before I go to bed.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Tunkiss and Sarah were too much overcome
to render assistance. Sarah was shaking
and jerking in every limb, and Leehanna had
got down her Bible to read about the fire and
brimstone rained on the cities of the plain, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>

the escape of Lot, and to conceive herself to be
a female Lot. Zita furnished herself with what
she required, and set vigorously to work, commenting
as she went on upon the bruises and
scratches in the varnish and paint, which the
sides of the van had received from the boots of
those who invaded it that evening.</p>

<p>She was engaged on the roof of the van,
when, all at once, her thoughts took a different
direction, and, kneeling upright, scrubbing-brush
in one hand and a piece of soap in the other,
she exclaimed—</p>

<p>'That was impudence, if you please! to tell
me he did not approve of Pip going after
Kainie, and that he will do his utmost to
make her happy! Does he think he can have
us both? That may be fen ways, it isn't
caravan morals. Hark!—what is that?'</p>

<p>She could hear the alarm bell of Ely Minster
pealing.</p>

<p>'There was a song of father's that I mind,'
said Zita, still kneeling upright, 'and if Mark
had only been brought up in a van instead of
desultory-like on the Fens, he'd have learned
the things he ought to do, and the things he
ought to leave alone, taught him by songs and
other ways.' She sang—</p>

<p>
'Young men, be advised, if love gets in your sconce,<br />
Don't ever go courting two maidens at once;<br />
With one you may work along safely and sound,<br />
'Twixt two stools you're certain to come to the ground.'<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>A lurid glare was in the sky over Ely, and
the bell continued to peal its note of distress.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Zita reverted to the threat of
Drownlands. He had said he would bring Mark
to the gallows, or, at all events, send him into
transportation.</p>

<p>This had seemed to her at the time an idle
threat, as the empty explosion of anger, that
could do no harm, whilst it relieved the master's
chafed feelings. But as she turned the matter
over in her head, it appeared to her no longer
as trifling a concern as she had at first supposed
it to be.</p>

<p>Mark had entered the house, and had induced
the master to part with his money to save his
ricks from being burnt down, and his house from
being broken into. This fact was capable of
two interpretations. Mark's purpose had been
obvious enough to her; but it was quite possible
for his action to be misrepresented as one of
sympathy with the rioters, and his interposition
as being due to his having been appointed
by them to act in their behalf.</p>

<p>Zita was now able to comprehend the purport
of Drownlands calling up the servants to
look at Mark, and to witness the payment of
the money. And at the same time she realised
the force of his words when he said that he had
paid the money to be rid of Mark. She could
penetrate to the inner chambers of Drownlands'
heart, and read there his thoughts and intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>If Mark were removed, it was likely that Zita
would prove more pliable. She would feel her
loneliness, her isolation, and be driven to accept
him as her protector. Zita was very angry
when these ideas rose in her mind. She
thought it incumbent on her to seek Runham
and warn him to be on his guard, especially to
avoid having any more connection with the
rioters. Drownlands had gone in the wake of
the mob; so, possibly, had Mark, out of curiosity—out
of a wish to intervene, as he had
intervened at Prickwillow.</p>

<p>Zita put down the pail, and, instead of returning
to the house, walked down the road that
led from the farm into the main drove by the
side of the Lark embankment.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">'I DON'T CARE THAT!'</p>

<p class="p1">ZITA was now seriously alarmed. She knew
that Drownlands was one who was without
scruple in carrying out the ends at which he
aimed.</p>

<p>He had not let drop these ominous words at
random. He hated Mark with deadly animosity,
and Zita knew very well the reason.
He loved her, and considered that Mark stood
in his way. He hoped, she did not question,
that by removing Mark there would remain no
other serious obstacle in the way of his suit.
Drownlands would not have recourse to violence.
The remembrance of what he had done to the
young man's father precluded that; but he
would not hesitate to adopt any other means
that promised to relieve him of his rival.</p>

<p>Zita had formed no plan as to what she would
do. She walked in the direction of Ely, on the
chance of catching Mark up, or of finding some
one who could inform her whether he had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

returned home to Crumbland, or had gone on
after the army of the discontented. She had
not walked a quarter of a mile before she saw
two figures standing on the embankment against
the illumined sky.</p>

<p>Zita was below, in the drove, and in shadow.
The roadway that had been snowy was now
trampled black, and a person walking or standing
on it would be invisible to those on the
bank, whereas the latter were in full view to such
as were on the drove, and their every movement
was made distinct by the reflection in the sky of
the fires kindled by the rioters in Ely.</p>

<p>Zita hardly, if at all, considered this. She did
not at first know who these persons were who
were pencilled against the red light behind them.
She had no reason for remaining concealed, but
she walked on a dark surface, and was therefore
invisible, and trod in springy peat, so that her
step was inaudible.</p>

<p>Before she could distinguish by their faces
who the two were upon the embankment, she
had discovered their personalities by their voices.
One was Mark Runham and the other was
Kainie.</p>

<p>Stung by jealousy, and instinctively, Zita
stood still. She heard Kainie say, 'I wish you
would go after him, Mark.'</p>

<p>Then she heard Runham answer, 'I cannot,
and I will not. I picked him out of the dyke,
streaming with fen-water—out of the dyke into

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

which his own comrades had flung him—and in
spite of all this he follows them. Such a fellow
as that is past helping. No one but Pip, after
being head, would consent to draggle at the end
of the body as its tail. What is more, Kainie, I
do not like your interesting yourself in him.
He is not for you. He has too many maggots
in his brain. There is no place will suit him.
Wherever he goes he will be in opposition.
Kainie, do you know the old country-dance
tune of "The Clean Contrary Way"? Well,
that is the only strain to which Pip will caper.'</p>

<p>'Poor Pip! He is not a bad fellow at heart.'</p>

<p>'Maybe; but he is terribly perverse. Possibly
he would be satisfied if he were translated to
what they call the Antipodes, for there his head
would be pointing where our feet run, and his
toes would be aiming in the direction of our
heads. Once for all, I am not going into Ely
after Pip. It is of no use, and my mother is in
alarm. I must return to appease her fears.
Now, Kainie, a word to you about yourself.'</p>

<p>'What about me?'</p>

<p>'Why, this: How long do you intend to
remain at Red Wings?'</p>

<p>'As long as I must. I suppose my uncle
Drownlands will do nothing for me.'</p>

<p>'But I will. You can have any money you
want from me.'</p>

<p>'I do not require it. I am happy at the mill.
I shall not leave it yet a while. I certainly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>

expect nothing from Uncle Ki. He never casts
me even a good-day. It is hard for me to suffer
because he quarrelled with my mother. I do
not suppose I shall ever be the better for my
relationship to him. Folks say he is going to
marry the Cheap Jack girl.'</p>

<p>Zita heard Mark's laugh, and then his answer.
'She will never take him.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'He is too old for her.'</p>

<p>'That will not trouble her much,' answered
Kainie; 'she calculates the value of everything,
and holds a thing to be worth just what money
it will bring in. I believe she has no thoughts,
no care for anything but money. She knows
that Uncle Ki has got land and stock, has a
good house and a balance at the bank; she will
say "There's profits," and take him—snap at
him eagerly.'</p>

<p>'I do not believe you,' said Mark, and laughed.
'But about yourself, not Zita. My mother still
objects to my bringing you home to Crumbland
and acknowledging you. I do not feel comfortable
and happy to be in a good house, and to
have you in that hovel at that mill.'</p>

<p>'I cannot go to you so long as your mother is
opposed.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not; but, after all, Kainie, she cannot
hold out against you for ever. She loves me
too sincerely. She has too right a mind. She
will see how it frets me; and then—when all is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>

said and done—I am master of Crumbland, and
not she. If I be driven to assert my will, she
will submit. She is certain to like, to love you,
when she comes to know you. It is but for a
little while waiting. I do not wish to have recourse
to strong measures if delay will make all go
smooth of itself. You understand that, Kainie?'</p>

<p>'I will wait. I am content at the mill. But—oh,
Mark! I must tell you a joke. That
Cheap Jack girl was at Red Wings the other
day, and she wanted to buy you of me—actually
purchase you.'</p>

<p>'At what price was I estimated?'</p>

<p>'At a ream of black-edged notepaper and
envelopes to match.'</p>

<p>Mark burst into laughter.</p>

<p>'That is not all,' continued Kainie. 'When I
did not prove eager for the paper, she made
another bid.'</p>

<p>'And that—?'</p>

<p>'Was a garden syringe to kill green-fly with
soapy water.'</p>

<p>Zita heard both laugh merrily.</p>

<p>'I have not done yet,' continued Kainie.
'She finally produced her most splendid offer.'</p>

<p>'And that was—?'</p>

<p>'It was one that almost made me surrender you,
Mark. A box of all kinds of scents. And she
said'—Kainie could hardly speak for laughing—'I
should smell of Jockey Club in chapel—tremenjous—that's
her word—tremenjous!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Zita's anger was flaming hot, waves of boiling
blood swept through her veins, swept before her
eyes and blinded her.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, she rushed up the bank,
and, reaching them, struck Kainie on the cheek
with her open palm before she or Mark knew
she was there.</p>

<p>'It is a shame!' exclaimed Zita, sobbing with
emotion. 'It is mean to tell of me—to make
sport of me!'</p>

<p>Then, turning on Mark, she said, 'And I will
tell you what is preparing for you—you who
laugh and jeer at the ignorant, silly Cheap Jack
girl. It is the gallows or Botany Bay. And'—she
snapped her fingers in his face—'if you hang
or are transported, I don't care that!'</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A NIGHT IN ELY</p>

<p class="p1">THE Isle of Ely, with the city in its midst,
and the cathedral in the midst of the
city, is more ecclesiastical than Rome itself.
Until comparatively recent times the Bishop
was a petty prince therein, exercising powers of
life and death. He did not indeed sit in the
courts himself, and himself sentence to the
block and the gallows, any more than did the
Pope himself consign offenders to the flames.
The secular power was committed to a 'Temporal
Steward,' who held his office for life, and
discharged the functions of High Sheriff, and the
Bishop washed his hands of all blood-guiltiness.</p>

<p>The courts of justice were, however, held in
the Bishop's name, and the gaols were institutions
under his jurisdiction. The Bishop appointed
the municipal authorities and the justices
of peace. From the High Sheriff to the town-crier,
all derived their authority by commission
from the Bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>As every acre of land in the isle and far away
into the fen belonged to either Bishop or Dean
and Chapter, there were no county magnates
near, and no country gentry at all. Nay, even
in the city itself there was no gentry of independent
position. In Rome there are princes who
have their territories. In Ely there were not
even squires.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the ecclesiastical dignitaries lived
very high up in roseate clouds and in an ethereal
atmosphere, far above the clay land where
grubbed and wriggled the professional men
and the shopkeepers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact of being so completely under
ecclesiastical government paralysed all initiative
in Ely, and rendered the inhabitants helpless in
cases of emergency. The citizens were but
overgrown babies. The lawyer, the surgeon, the
M.D., the surveyor, the architect, were accustomed
to be swaddled and given suck by the Right
Reverend Father the Bishop, or the Very Reverend
the Dean, or the Venerable the Archdeacon;
and all the officials, the temporal steward, and
the justices, and the chief constable, were wont
to go in leading-strings.</p>

<p>And they were such good babies. They
always thought as the reverend fathers thought;
they never cried and kicked; and the air of the
Fens must have been salubrious, for they had all
ravenous appetites for the fat of the land, which
fell from the ecclesiastical tables. At the time

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>

of our tale, co-operative stores had not been so
much as thought of. The Bishop, the Dean, and
the canons got their groceries, their drugs, their
wines, and their stationery from the Ely tradesmen.
In return for their custom, these tradesmen
professed the strictest churchmanship and
the staunchest Toryism.</p>

<p>The system of appointment to offices in Ely
was distinctively ecclesiastical. The magistrates
were bespectacled and bewigged officials connected
by marriage with some of the members
of the Chapter. The constables were nominated
for their general piety, or because they were
burdened with large families. The watchmen
were pensioned cripples or asthmatic incapables,
whose utmost achievement was to crawl about
at night and proclaim the hour. Everything in
the city was managed for the residents by a
benevolent and beneficent ecclesiastical authority,
which exhibited its benevolence and beneficence
by conferring offices, not on such as showed
efficiency, but on such men as were incompetent
to earn a livelihood in any profession or business
that demanded the exercise of brain or of
muscle.</p>

<p>When the turbulent crew from Littleport
arrived in Ely, and the rumour circulated that
other Fen centres were sending their contingents
of the disaffected to the capital of the Fens,
neither magistrates nor constables were prepared
to take prompt action to protect the town and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>

stop the spread of disturbance. Orders were
indeed issued to have the minster bell rung, to
summon all sober, law-abiding citizens to unite
for the common defence, but, although the bell
pealed its summons, no one obeyed it, for no
one knew where the rallying-point was, or what
was to be done by those summoned.</p>

<p>The temporal steward was in bed with a
mustard poultice on his chest and a dose of
sweet nitre in his stomach. Consequently, when
a messenger from the Deanery came to request
that he would do something, the wife of the
temporal steward was able to point out that he
was perspiring freely and the poultice drawing
vigorously. To leave his bed and the house
was, therefore, out of the question.</p>

<p>There was no deputy sheriff to fill the place
which the sheriff was incapacitated from filling.
The vacancy had not been filled up, because the
Bishop was hesitating, balancing the claims of
one who was stone-blind against one who was
stone-deaf. The prelate himself was absent on
a confirmation tour, and he had taken his
chaplains with him, and, what was more to the
point, his butler—a man who did most of the
thinking in sublunary matters for his master.
The constables then in Ely were few. The chief
constable, Mr. Edwards, was the manager of
Mortlock's bank, and in the interests of the bank
he had come to the resolution to keep in the
background so as in no way to excite the angry

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>

passions of the mob. Another constable had
swallowed a fish-bone, and this was being extracted
by a fellow constable. A fourth was at
the moment incapacitated for work by one of
his constitutional and chronic fits of the hiccups.
It was precisely because he suffered from this
affliction that the benevolent and beneficent
ecclesiastical authority had nominated him to,
and invested him with, the office of constable.</p>

<p>As the combined municipal and collegiate
forces of watchmen were unprepared or unable
to cope with the approaching masses of men,
the Dean sent off his coachman on a carriage
horse to Bury St. Edmund's, to invoke the aid
of the military stationed there. The mob from
Littleport entered the town, as already said,
preceded by the waggon, in which were placed
heavy wash guns loaded with slugs. To announce
its arrival a volley was fired, and the
slugs rattled on the tiles and broke a few
windows.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Littleport body entered
Ely, than it learned to its disappointment that
nothing had been heard of the Isleham and
Swaffham contingents.</p>

<p>In fact, discouragement had dissolved these at
the onset. The small landowner, Cutman, who
had undertaken to lead the detachment from
Isleham, had reconsidered the matter, and
resolved that heading a riot could do him no
possible good, and might do him very considerable

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>

harm. The men assembled at the Duck at
the appointed hour, waited, and, as he did not
appear, became uneasy, supposing that he had
been alarmed; they also reconsidered the matter,
and, coming to much the same conclusion as
Cutman, dispersed quietly to their several
homes.</p>

<p>The Swaffham men were also defaulters.
The tidings of what was meditated had been
communicated to a large farmer there, and when
the rabble approached, he met them dauntlessly,
along with his stalwart sons and some trusty
serving-men, all armed with blunderbusses.
He addressed the mob, and, by his bold front
and resolute bearing, not only prevented them
from attacking his house, but persuaded them to
break up and abandon their undertaking.</p>

<p>The Littleport body, swelled by stragglers,
and also by men who had lived in the suburbs
of Ely, formed a considerable host, and had they
been under efficient discipline, and had they
known exactly what demands to make, and how
to enforce their demands, might have produced
serious results.</p>

<p>As it was, they did a certain amount of
mischief, and took a certain amount of loot, but
all in an aimless manner; and in looting or
wrecking forgot the ostensible reasons for their
assembly and purpose of marching upon Ely.</p>

<p>No sooner were they in the town than the
mob resolved itself, without order given, into

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>

two detachments, whereof one attacked the
flour-mills, and the other broke into the
victuallers' shops to seize on their stores of
ham, bacon, and sausages.</p>

<p>There was a large soak-mill in the lower part
of the town, managed by a man named Rickwood.
This was the first assailed.</p>

<p>By this time the magistrates, at the advice
and exhortation of their wives, had plucked up
sufficient courage to venture to parley with the
rioters. There were but three or four of these
in the place; one was a retired steward who
was almost stone-deaf, the other two were
clergymen. These magistrates inquired of the
fen-men what were their demands, and were
answered with confused cries for higher wages,
cheaper bread, and for money to be scattered
among them.</p>

<p>Terrified by the shouts and the menacing
attitude of the mob, they entered into negotiations
with them, and offered to raise a certain
sum of money from the inhabitants to satisfy
their illegal demands. But the rioters could not
agree as to the price at which they would desist
from violence, nor could they wait with patience
till the magistrates had collected the sum offered.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the conference was broken up,
and the mob proceeded to smash Rickwood's
windows and to beat open his doors.</p>

<p>The miller was not, as it chanced, at home
himself, and his wife entered into parley with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>

the rabble from a window. They demanded
fifty pounds, and threatened, unless it were paid,
to proceed to set fire to the mill, and the miller's
habitation adjoining.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rickwood, in terror, promised the sum,
but said that she had not so much coin in the
house. She would send her son for the money
to the bank.</p>

<p>'No! no! Come yourself!' shouted the men,
and proceeded to demolish the windows.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mrs. Rickwood descended, and
in deadly fear issued forth into the street, after
having committed the mill to the care of her
son.</p>

<p>The banker was also, as already said, chief
constable, and in the interest of Messrs. Mortlock
was remaining at home, and sitting in his
back parlour.</p>

<p>When the mob reached his house, which was
one with the bank, loud cries were raised for
him, and Mrs. Rickwood knocked at the front
door. After long waiting, he appeared in the
doorway, as white as chalk. Mrs. Rickwood
then entreated him to furnish her with fifty
sovereigns in gold, in order that she might
purchase immunity for her mill from the insurgent
peasantry.</p>

<p>'Nothing in the world will induce me to do
this!' exclaimed the chief constable heroically.
Whereupon a stone was thrown at him, and
struck his head, so that a little blood flowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>'That is to say,' said Edwards, 'nothing save
compulsion;' and he hastened within to find the
money.</p>

<p>The second body of rioters in the meantime
was engaged in sacking the grocery-shops and
provision-stores. One of the magistrates, the
Rev. Mr. Metcalf, endeavoured to calm the mob
by an assurance that he would induce the
owners of the shops to purchase their immunity.
But he was successful in two instances only.
In some the rabble took the money, and, notwithstanding,
plundered the shops. Then a
second mill was attacked, but, on ten pounds
being produced, no further violence was done
to it.</p>

<p>The night was dark. The rioters went round
requisitioning faggots and coals, and soon an
immense bonfire was kindled before the cathedral
west front, and a second in face of St. Mary's
church. The first lighted up the splendid pile,
bringing out every detail of sculpture, and
twinkling in the glass that filled the Norman
windows.</p>

<p>Round this fire the young men and girls
danced. Some of the men had carried provisions
to the Galilee, and prepared for a
carouse. The taverns had been attacked very
early, and the publicans had been constrained to
allow the rioters free use of their liquor.</p>

<p>As Mark had assured Kerenhappuch, Ephraim
Beamish had pushed his way after the rabble,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>

undeterred by the treatment he had received at
its hands, his enthusiasm unquenched by his
plunge in the icy water. As there was no
organisation in the mob, he was suffered to
rejoin it with an occasional protest only, but
Chevell, Harley, and Tansley would not allow
him to remount the waggon.</p>

<p>No sooner did Beamish find that a great body
of the insurgents were setting themselves to eat,
drink, and revel about the great fire in front of the
cathedral, than he got a chair, and endeavoured
to harangue them, to point out to them that
they were throwing away their occasion, neglecting
to enforce their grievances on the employers
of labour, and that they were making enemies
among all the well-disposed by their capricious
and lawless proceedings. But directly his face
was discerned by the flicker of the fire, and his
voice recognised, beaten back by the cathedral
walls, than shouts were raised of, 'That's the
fellow who stole the Cheap Jack girl's money.
We want no preaching here.'</p>

<p>His chair was tripped up, and he was sent
sprawling in the dirt.</p>

<p>He rose angry and disconcerted. The movement
of which he was the instigator, and of
which he had been appointed director by vote
of the men, had rejected his direction, and was
taking its own suicidal course.</p>

<p>The fens immediately surrounding the isle on
which Ely stood were farmed by men whose

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>

homesteads were on the gault excrescence that
formed the isle. According to the preconcerted
scheme, the Union of Fen Labourers was to proceed
to these farmsteads one by one, to exact
of the farmers a contribution to the cause, and
an oath to raise the wage.</p>

<p>It was true enough that two or three farms had
been visited which lay to right and left of the
road from Littleport to Ely, but no sooner had
the men reached the Fen capital, than they
forgot their purpose, directed their attention to
the provision-shops, waylaid and blackmailed
passengers, broke into the taverns, and thought
only of eating, drinking, and making money.
They entirely neglected the scheme that had
been agreed to. Not a single farm in the isle
was molested, not a single farmer coerced.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">SIR BATES DUDLEY'S RIDE</p>

<p class="p1">AFTER a night of revelry, the winter morning
broke on men lying tipsy or asleep about
the smouldering embers of their fire, against the
walls of houses, or crowded on the benches and
on the stone floor of the Galilee. Every tavern
was packed, and many private houses as well.
The rioters had demanded admission, and had
threatened violence if opposed. Doors had accordingly
been opened to them, and they had
received reluctant admission.</p>

<p>On the whole, little serious mischief had been
done. A few shops had been invaded, a few
well-to-do persons blackmailed, some windows
broken, all the ale and spirits in the public-houses
drunk out, and all the hams in the
licensed victuallers' consumed; but with the sole
exception of the cutting open of the head of the
chief constable, no personal violence had been
done to any one.</p>

<p>The demonstration had been absolutely resultless,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>

so far as concerned the purpose for
which it had been organised. The only fruit
that would come of it would be that the bakers,
millers, and provision-dealers would raise their
prices, so as to recoup themselves for what they
had lost, and that certain of the rioters would
suffer penalties out of all proportion to the
injury done.</p>

<p>Some consciousness that a mistake had been
made stole over the dull brains of the men as
they awoke, chilled and headachy, on the morning
after the entry into Ely. Those men who
had promoted the movement, but had not been
suffered to direct it, were certainly alive to the
fact that a great blunder had been made, and
that their safety was at stake. And when the
rumour spread that the dragoons from Bury
were about to arrive, the pot-valiant fen-men
rapidly dispersed.</p>

<p>Droves and roads radiating from Ely were
thronged with fugitives, flying at their utmost
speed towards their homes, and none speeding
more rapidly than those men who were guardians
of the money collected from the farmers and
shopmen and millers for the cause, and who
sought not only to secure their persons, but
also the money they carried with them, for
their own advantage. The sum collected might
enable them to escape from the neighbourhood,
and it would form a comfortable little capital on
which to start business where they were unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>When, about noon, the military arrived, the
streets of Ely were almost as silent and unoccupied
as on any day in the week save
market day.</p>

<p>They were met by the magistrates, preceded
by Sir Bates Dudley, Bart., an old canon of
Ely; the chief constable showed with his head
bandaged, and the high sheriff looked approval
from his bedroom window, in nightcap and
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Orders were issued for the pursuit of the
rioters to Littleport, their headquarters. As it
was necessary that a magistrate should accompany
them, Sir Bates Dudley was lifted into
a saddle. He was a small, very globular man,
with a red face and a wig of sandy hair.</p>

<p>'You won't go very fast with me?' inquired
the baronet of the officer in charge. 'Be—be—cause,
though I was a horseman oo—oo—once,
I haven't ridden these forty years.'</p>

<p>Then, turning to his footman, he said, 'Tut—Tut—Thomas,
you'll please to run at my s—s—ide,
and hold my leg, lest I tut—tut—tumble
off. If you see me getting at all out of the
per—per—per—pendicular, just run round
and give a pull to the other leg.'</p>

<p>Presently Sir Bates Dudley addressed Drownlands,
who was standing near him, holding his
own horse.</p>

<p>'You will cuc—come too—so important a
witness; and you will indicate who are the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>

persons to be arrested, and who are na—na—named
in the warrants I signed. You
will oblige me if you will ri—ride at my side,
and as Tut—Tut—Thomas is negligent, and
his at—at—tention may be distracted, and he
may forget his doo—doo—dooty to me, if you
see me at all out of the per—per—perpendicular,
just give a thrust, will you, with your
riding-whip, and set me up—pup—right again.
I haven't ridden for forty years. I hope the
saddle won't ga—ga—gall the horse.'</p>

<p>'I'll keep at your side, sir,' said Drownlands.</p>

<p>'That wo—wo—won't be quite enough,' said
the baronet. 'If you wouldn't mind keeping an
eye on my left leg, and if you see it go—go—going
up the side of the saddle, just tut—trot
round the ba—ba—back and give me a thrust
with the end of your whip, and set me per—per—perpendicular
again. I can't trust Tut—Tut—Thomas
entirely.'</p>

<p>'I'll do what I can for you, sir,' said Drownlands.</p>

<p>Then Sir Bates turned to his man Thomas
and said—</p>

<p>'Ki—ki—keep an even habit of mind, Tut—Thomas,
and don't let your thoughts ramble to
Mary. Don't pup—pup—pull my right leg too
hard, nor let it go too lax.'</p>

<p>Then, addressing Drownlands—</p>

<p>'I am shush—shush—sure the Government and
all law-abiding citizens owe a debt of gratitude

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>

to you, Mr. Dud—Dud—Drownlands.' The
baronet gasped at the name, opening his mouth
and jerking his face forward, as though endeavouring
to catch a bluebottle and swallow it.
'I con—con—congratulate you on your activity,
observation, and spirit. You will be the primary
means of convicting the ri—ri—rioters.'</p>

<p>The canon rode along, balancing himself uncertainly
in his saddle. The dragoons trotted
after.</p>

<p>When, however, the clay land of the Isle of
Ely was left, trotting was out of the question.
The horses made their way painfully through
the slough, and military order was not to be
maintained.</p>

<p>Sir Bates's horse tossed his head, and endeavoured
to keep up a trot. There is pride in
brutes as well as in men, and the baronet's steed
was elate at the idea of preceding the splendid
dragoon chargers, so well groomed, so gorgeously
accoutred, and bearing such radiant beings on
their backs. Let the fen cart-horses see that
he, Sir Bates Dudley's cob, took precedence of,
was on gracious terms with, these war chargers.
Every now and then, when a horse was visible
in a stubble field, he neighed to him a challenge
to observe who went by and in what company.</p>

<p>'I don't quite like this mo—mo—motion,'
gasped the canon, who was bouncing like a pea
on a drum. 'I am afraid the saddle will terribly
ga—ga—gall my horse's back.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Drownlands uttered an exclamation,
and, turning to the colonel of the
dragoons, cried, as he pointed with his whip at
a figure in a field separated from the drove by a
lane of water—</p>

<p>'There is Ephraim Beamish, a ringleader.
A warrant against him is signed. He has the
audacity to look on as though this did not
concern him.'</p>

<p>The colonel gave orders to two of his soldiers
to ride in pursuit. The men detailed for the
purpose at once leaped their horses across the
dyke. The road bank was sufficiently firm to
enable the beasts to spring.</p>

<p>Then they started in pursuit.</p>

<p>'Shoot! Shoot!' cried Drownlands. 'You
will never take a prisoner like that.'</p>

<p>The dragoons were careering over the field,
one of fifteen to twenty acres, but it was hard
work for the horses, so spongy was the soil; and
Pip Beamish ran before them without greatly
exerting himself.</p>

<p>The dragoons on the drove, at the command
of the colonel, drew up in line, and watched the
chase.</p>

<p>'They will never catch him,' repeated Drownlands;
'they never can. Give orders that he be
shot.'</p>

<p>'I cannot do that,' said the officer in command.
'They will outstrip and head him shortly.'</p>

<p>'They never will. You do not know the Fens.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>In another moment Beamish was seen to
plant a long pole he was carrying, swing himself
aloft easily and gracefully, and fall lightly on
his feet on the farther side of the dyke limiting
the field.</p>

<p>One of the dragoon's horses floundered and
rolled over in the soft soil, but the other was
close behind Beamish. It rose, and in a moment
vanished along with its rider in the dyke. The
hind feet had found nothing substantial on
which to obtain the necessary purchase for a
leap across the water, and the beast and rider
had fallen into the stagnant, slimy liquid that
filled the ditch.</p>

<p>In spite of discipline, oaths and curses broke
from the dragoons who were looking on.</p>

<p>'I knew it,' said Drownlands. 'Why did you
not shoot? If that horse hasn't broke his back
it is a lucky job. Now Pip Beamish is beyond
reach, beyond gunshot, and it will take a day to
get the horse dug out.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked the colonel
angrily.</p>

<p>'Mean? Why, that no horse that falls into a
dyke can get himself out, or be got out save by
spade-work. There he must remain; every
struggle makes him sink deeper. There is no
bottom to the dykes till you reach the clay, and
for that you must go down twenty feet. He
will never do it again, if that is any consolation
to you. But ten to one his back is broke, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>

you may as well send a bullet through his
head.'</p>

<p>'Here,' shouted the colonel, 'dismount and go
help Standish out.' He beckoned to three men.</p>

<p>'Help him out?' mocked Drownlands. 'They
can't do it. They must have workmen that
understand the business. They must have the
proper tools. You don't happen to have brought
any "beckets" with you, I suppose?'</p>

<p>The man who had been precipitated into the
water, was now seen on the bank. He had
scrambled out by means of the reeds that grew
rankly in the ooze. He was stamping, his
splendid accoutrements were tarnished, and the
foul fen-water was streaming from him. Holding
the reins, by coaxing words he endeavoured
to encourage his horse to struggle out of the
water. The poor brute made efforts to escape,
churning up the sludgy mud and peat in the
dyke, but was incapable of doing anything to
extricate himself. The more he struggled the
deeper he sank.</p>

<p>When the situation was thoroughly realised—and
the colonel would not for some time believe
the assertion of Drownlands that the horse
could be extricated by no other means than
the formation of an incline by spade labour—then
he consented grudgingly to negotiate with
some loafers who had followed the troop, and
by promises of liberal payment to engage them
to undertake the rescue of the charger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>When this was settled,—and it took some
time to settle,—the body of soldiers advanced
towards Littleport. Tidings had come that
the rioters were making a rally there, and intended
to contest the way with the military.
That they were armed was known, as also that
the fowlers of the Fens were crack shots. If
they held to their resolution, Littleport would
not be occupied without effusion of blood.</p>

<p>It was indeed true that a rally had been
made at Littleport. The men living there,
fearing that they would be arrested for the
part they had taken in the disturbance, spoke
of defending themselves—better die with guns
in their hands, they said, than swing on the
scaffold. But now, as before, there was neither
discipline nor cohesion among the men. The
colonel knew that they had no leaders, and did
not greatly concern himself at the menace. He
was impatient to reach Littleport, not lest the
rioters should gather force, but to get finished
with an unpleasant and inglorious affair. Moreover,
at Littleport most of the arrests would
have to be made, and it was as well to reach
it as speedily as possible, before every rioter
had hidden under a bed, or in a rabbit-hole.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a considerable number of
persons assembled on the drove, partly to stare
at the unprecedented sight of the glittering
military parade, but partly also as a means of
exhibiting their own peaceful demeanour, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>

showing that they had no sympathy with the
disturbers of tranquillity. As it happened, some
of the men who had been instigators to violence
thought this a happy way of throwing a veil
over their past proceedings. By putting on a
look of sheep-like innocence, and thrusting themselves
forward, they hoped to escape. But they
had miscalculated. They might have escaped,
but for the presence of Drownlands, who had
followed the mob, watched its proceedings,
had taken note of everything done, and of
the doers, and had denounced some forty men
to the magistrates, and was now accompanying
the military and Sir Bates Dudley, to point
out those of whom it was advisable to make an
example, and who were already down on his
'information,' and against whom warrants had
been issued.</p>

<p>'I think,' said Sir Bates, 'that if I am not
absolutely nec—cess—cessary, I would rather
return to Ely. The saddle somehow does not
fit the horse.'</p>

<p>'We must have a magistrate with us,' said the
officer in command of the dragoons.</p>

<p>The canon looked piteously about him, drew
out a silk pocket-handkerchief, and wiped his
brow.</p>

<p>'It is of the horse I am thinking. A gall is
so painful, so very pup—pup—painful to the
horse. I will do my dud—dud—duty, however
painful it may be to the horse.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldiery trotted on to Littleport. There
the rioters had overthrown a waggon across the
road, and by means of bundles of straw had
composed a rude barricade. The resistance
offered by them was feeble and half-hearted.
The sight of the dragoons overawed the men,
and several, after firing from behind the bundles,
slunk away.</p>

<p>The soldiers speedily passed the barricade
and dashed among the men who remained. A
shot from behind a garden paling broke a
dragoon's arm, another brought down one of
the chargers. This encouraged the men for a
moment, and they sprang at the heads of the
horses, whilst others assailed the riders with
pitchforks. There ensued a brief hand-to-hand
scuffle. But when one of the rioters was shot
through the head, and the men saw that the
soldiers were determined no longer to trifle
with them, they fled in all directions.</p>

<p>Numerous arrests were made, and then the
dragoons returned towards Ely, Sir Bates jogging
before them, and their captives well
guarded in their midst.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TWO PLEADERS</p>

<p class="p1">THE tidings that the dragoons were on
their way to Littleport had hardly
spread sufficiently in the forenoon to draw
together great quantities of spectators, but after
they had gone by it was otherwise. The news
flew like wildfire over the Fens, and the inhabitants
of the district came in troops and
lined the road, so that they might have the
satisfaction of seeing the military, and taking
account of the number of prisoners they had
taken.</p>

<p>The fen-folk are all more or less closely
connected by marriage, forming a people to
themselves, separate in interests, customs, and
character from those who live on the high
grounds. They have been wont for generations
to seek their mates among themselves, with the
result that a close family connection binds
the whole population together. The number
of cases in the Fens in which a woman, on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>

marriage, retains her maiden name is quite unequalled
elsewhere. Whoever might be taken
up by the military was certain to be akin to
some of the lookers-on, and therefore the spectacle
anticipated on the return of the dragoons
was calculated to engage their interest and excite
their sympathies.</p>

<p>Among the yeomen there is intermarriage
with cousins for the sake of adding acre to
acre and barn to barn, but among the labouring
population no such inducement prevails. They
choose their wives from among their blood
relatives, because the idea never crosses their
minds to go elsewhere to find mates. They
must marry cousins or not marry at all, and
the question resolves itself in one of degrees of
consanguinity.</p>

<p>As nearly, if not all, the wealthy landowners
are grandsons or great-grandsons of half-wild
fen-slodgers, it follows that they are knitted by
blood ties to the labourers they employ. This
does not necessarily increase good fellowship,
nor promote forbearance. The purse-proud
yeoman is the harshest master. He draws
the line of sympathy at the mark of the class
to which he belongs, a class of recent creation.
He holds fast to his brother yeoman, and both
together grind down their brother labourer.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs was of course more
noticeable formerly than at present. Each
generation separates the well-to-do a step

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>

farther from their poor relations. Our story
refers to events and conditions some decades
ago.</p>

<p>On account of the tyranny exercised by the
masters, little consideration was felt for them by
the men when they broke out in revolt, although
allied to them by blood; and the stacks that
had been fired were in several instances set in
flames by the blood relatives of the owners of
the stacks.</p>

<p>As the dragoons trotted along the road towards
Ely, exclamations and lamentations
broke out as the men they had taken were
recognised by those who lined the highway.</p>

<p>'There is Robert Cheesewright! Oh dear!
what will the old Robert do without him?'</p>

<p>'Be still. They have not taken Robert. He
is going as a witness against Pip Beamish.
That's why he is there.'</p>

<p>'Well, they have handcuffed James Cammel,
anyhow, and he was going to marry my Beulah.
If they hang him, Beulah will have to take
Aaron Layton instead, that's all.'</p>

<p>'There is Joseph Lavender. He is my wife's
son by her first husband. She will take on
dreadful, and I shan't have my shirt properly
washed, nor my pasty full baked—that's what
it means to me.'</p>

<p>'They have taken Flanders Hopkins and
Richard Rutter.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and look you there. That's Isaac Harley,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>

as was in the waggon. I wish I had Isaac's
gun, I'd shoot the chap that has charge of him.
How ever came Isaac to be taken?'</p>

<p>'Ay; and he is cuffed to Joseph Stibbard.'</p>

<p>'Stibbard broke into the parson's house at
Littleport, and took his silver spoons and
money.'</p>

<p>'He needed them more than did the parson.'</p>

<p>'Of course he did, and had a right to take
them. Joseph Stibbard's sister married my
nephew, Philip Easy. I hope he handed on
the spoons to her before the soldiers took
him.'</p>

<p>Such were the comments passed. Some of
those looking on endeavoured to push between
the soldiers, and get at their relatives who
were being conveyed to prison, but were repelled
by their guards. Comments of another
sort were expressed less loudly, though not less
frankly.</p>

<p>'There rides Drownlands. He has been
along with the dragoons all the day. He has
been pointing out whom they are to take; and
if there is hanging to be done, i' fecks! it is he
who has twisted the rope for their necks, poor
fellows.'</p>

<p>'I knew he was out and about all last night.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and has been all this morning with
the magistrates. But they haven't taken Pip
Beamish yet.'</p>

<p>'I am sure they would be put to it for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>

witnesses, if it were not for Tiger Ki. Which
of us would peach? Wouldn't we do the other
thing, and swear 'em off?'</p>

<p>'You are right there. I suppose Ki Drownlands
knows what he is doing. But I reckon
that this will be remembered against him, and
he will be paid out for it some day or other.'</p>

<p>'Trust our chaps for that, and the day will
not be distant.'</p>

<p>Drownlands observed the sullen looks, the
scowls with which he was greeted, and noticed
the whispers that passed as he rode by, but
treated all with indifference or contempt.</p>

<p>'They do not love me. I scoff at them,' said
he to Sir Bates Dudley. 'They have done
their worst. We are clearing the Fens of the
only lads with any spirit in them to do mischief.
Those that remain are arrant cowards.'</p>

<p>Then he turned his horse's head down the
drove to Prickwillow. 'I am not needed till
to-morrow. Here is my home.'</p>

<p>His eye lighted on Zita, who had come forth
to see the soldiers pass with their prisoners.
Near her were Mrs. Tunkiss, Sarah, and the
farm serving-men.</p>

<p>Zita uttered an exclamation and ran forward,
caught Drownlands' horse by the bridle, and
exclaimed—</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this? Why is
Mark Runham taken? This is your doing.'</p>

<p>'Why not? He headed the rioters.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>'He did not head them. It is false. You
know it is so. Set him at liberty at once.'</p>

<p>'I cannot do that. He has been arrested.
He will appear before the magistrates to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Very well, so will I. I can bear witness as
well as you.'</p>

<p>Then Zita darted nimbly between the
soldiers, in spite of their protests, which were
not roughly enforced, for the quick eyes of the
dragoons saw that she was pretty. She made
her way to Mark, who was handcuffed.</p>

<p>'Mark,' said she, 'I will help you.'</p>

<p>'You?' he answered. 'You said it was all
one to you whether I were hanged or transported.
I am innocent, and will be discharged
without your help.'</p>

<p>'Back!' ordered the dragoon on the right,
and Zita was forced to retreat.</p>

<p>As she did so, she saw Kainie by Drownlands.
The girl had seized his bridle, and was
gesticulating with vehemence.</p>

<p>'It is your doing,' said Kerenhappuch. 'You
hate him. You try to destroy him. You are
heaping to yourself wrath against the day of
wrath.'</p>

<p>'Let go my bridle,' ordered Drownlands.</p>

<p>'You are my uncle,' insisted the girl, her
fair hair blown over her face. With one hand
she brushed it back, but did not release her
hold on the bridle. 'Although you have not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

treated me as of like flesh and blood with yourself,
yet you cannot undo it; I am your niece,
and speak to you I will, now.'</p>

<p>'Let go, I say. I will hold no communication
with you.' He struck his spurs into the sides
of his horse, which reared. But Kainie would
not let go. The plunging of the horse made
the curb nip and cut Kainie's hand, and some
blood came over it. She changed hands on the
bridle.</p>

<p>'Look!' said she. 'You cannot help it. This
is Drownlands blood. It is Drownlands blood
appeals to you now.'</p>

<p>Then Zita laid her hand on the bridle, on the
farther side of the beast.</p>

<p>'We are two girls,' she said, 'and we will stay
you, man though you be. Kainie and I are
enemies, we do not love each other, but we unite
in beseeching you to do justice to one man.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' said the mill-girl. 'Uncle Ki, you are
bent on evil, and we will hold you back against
plunging farther into the slough.'</p>

<p>'Mark never intended to injure you,' said the
Cheap Jack girl. 'He sought to save your
property for you. Why should you work for
his destruction?'</p>

<p>'You shall withdraw your charge against him
before all the world,' said Kainie.</p>

<p>'You shall break the shackles off his hands
yourself,' said Zita.</p>

<p>Drownlands dug his spurs wrathfully into

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>

the flanks of the horse, and clenched his teeth
and hands. But though the beast was wounded
and bounded, his head was held too firmly for
him to break away.</p>

<p>'Shall I grip your foot till you scream,'
exclaimed Zita, 'as I did on the night when I
stayed you before?'</p>

<p>'Will you kill Mark, as you killed his father?'
asked Kainie.</p>

<p>Her words were random words. She spoke
in the vehemence of her wrath against Drownlands,
and anxiety for Runham. She knew
nothing definite against her uncle, but she had
heard the whispered gossip of the Fens.</p>

<p>'I will have justice on all who have wronged
me,' muttered Drownlands.</p>

<p>'Take care!' exclaimed Kainie, raising the
disengaged hand, down which ran a trickle of
blood. 'Do not think that because some of the
poor lads have been taken, because ten out of
one hundred are handcuffed, that every heart
that is full of bitterness is beating behind prison
walls, and every hand that can be raised against
you is fettered. There are ninety pairs for
every ten you put in iron cuffs, and they will
be clenched in rage and resolve of revenge the
day that you send the poor fellows to the
gallows.'</p>

<p>'I fear them not,' said Drownlands scornfully.</p>

<p>'You may not fear, but that is because, like
Pharaoh, your heart is hardened and your eyes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>

are blinded, and the Lord is driving you to
your destruction. I am here to stand between
you—I, as your niece—between you and what
threatens.'</p>

<p>'What threatens?'</p>

<p>'You are threatened.'</p>

<p>'Who threatens me?'</p>

<p>'Pip Beamish for one.'</p>

<p>'Ha! he will be arrested speedily.'</p>

<p>'No, not speedily. He is not taken yet, and
till he is taken you are not safe.'</p>

<p>'I will see that he be not at large for long.
Before this week is out he will be in prison.'</p>

<p>'That may be a few days too many for
you.'</p>

<p>'I fear not your Pip Beamish; your braggarts
do nothing.'</p>

<p>'No, braggarts do nothing; but Pip is no
braggart.'</p>

<p>'It is my turn now,' said Zita. 'You, Kainie,
have tried and have failed. Leave him to me.
I can employ reasons that are stronger than
yours. Let go your hold of the horse's head.
You have said your say. Now I will say mine.
But none must hear us.'</p>

<p>Kainie reluctantly released the bit. Then
Zita, still with her hand on the bridle, strode
in the direction of Prickwillow, leading the
horse, and some of the people congregated on
the drove looked after her and the master, and
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>'He has found his mistress,' said one man,
nudging his fellow.</p>

<p>'Ay, and is following her lead like a lamb,'
replied the man who had been nudged.</p>

<p>'Who leads today will drive to-morrow,' said
a third.</p>

<p>'Is he going to marry her?' asked the first.</p>

<p>The man addressed shrugged his shoulders
and said, 'No money. Drownlands is not such
a fool as that.'</p>

<p>None of this was heard by Zita, who did not
relax her hold, nor turn to look at those who
were left in the road. The master suffered her
to conduct him towards the house without
making remonstrance.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A DEAL</p>

<p class="p1">WHEN Zita was beyond earshot, she
looked over her shoulder, and said to
Drownlands, 'I call that mean.'</p>

<p>She walked on, then halted, changed her
hand on the bridle, and, gazing about, said,
'You could free yourself of him in no other
fashion, so you swear his life away. But you
have to reckon with me before it comes to that.
I will go into court and swear against you.
What I shall swear to will be the truth; your
oath will bind you to lies.'</p>

<p>'I refuse to strive with you in words,' retorted
Drownlands. 'A woman is always victor with
such weapons.'</p>

<p>'What? you prefer flails?—those are your
weapons,' exclaimed Zita, clenching her fist and
holding her arm extended before her. 'I know
well why you are set against Mark Runham.
You think that he is something in some way to
me, and that I am much to him. It is because

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>

of this that you pursue him. It is because of
me that you twist the rope round his throat.
But you are wrong altogether. I will not say
that Mark is nothing to me. He was kind to
me once; kind when my heart was tender,
because my father was just buried. But I am
nothing to Mark. He mocks at me. He
sneers and laughs at the Cheap Jack girl. He
does not love me; and, moreover, he is bound
to another.'</p>

<p>'Mark bound to another? Who is that?'</p>

<p>'Nay, it is his affair, and he has not given me
leave to tell his secrets. But you may guess.'</p>

<p>Drownlands' face testified his surprise.</p>

<p>'I cannot guess,' he said, after a long pause.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Zita, 'father's word was true, that
in such matters men are blind. We girls see—and
I ought to see, for Mark has not played me
fair. He did let me think he fancied me; but
I think so no more. He has made me angry
with him, and I am angry with him still. But
there is a step beyond which I will not go. If
I could punish him I would—but not with the
rope or Botany Bay. You know that he came
into your house in a friendly mind, and with
kind intent. You know that he was not in
league with that topsy-turvy general public.
I shall hate and despise you, as I thought I
could hate and despise no man, if you swear
falsely against him.'</p>

<p>'He has stood between us,' said Drownlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>'He has not done so,' retorted Zita. 'Your
own deeds lie between us, not Mark Runham.
The events of that night lie between us as a
wall of ice reaching up to heaven, that can
neither be climbed nor undermined. Listen to
me, master. I hate to be mean; but if you
drive me to desperation, if I see no other way
to save Mark's life, I will do even that which is
mean.'</p>

<p>'What is that? I do not understand.'</p>

<p>'I have no wish to do it. I shall hate myself
if I do it. You were good to my poor father,
and to me. When all was dark and cold about
me, you opened to me your house and fireside.
You have harboured me, my horse, and the van.
I would not speak a word to mortal man of
what I know. They might tear the flesh off
my bones with fiery pincers, and my mouth
would remain shut. I owe you an infinite debt
of gratitude, and I would repay it. But there
is one thing I cannot do—I cannot suffer you
to send Mark to the gallows. Rather than do
that, I will speak, and tell the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, about the two flails.'</p>

<p>Drownlands was silent. His face had
changed to a clay colour, and his lips were
tightly drawn on his teeth.</p>

<p>'And if it be any comfort to you to know
this,' pursued Zita, as she opened the hand
extended before her: 'if you will drop this
charge against Mark, retract every word you

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>

have said in his disfavour, I will swear to you
to have nothing more to do with Mark all your
days upon earth. He shall be to me no other
than a stranger. I will stop my ears against
him if he should try to speak to me flattering
words. I will turn my head away if the fancy
takes him to look at me with kindly eyes.
There, Ki Drownlands, I have made you an offer
now. I threw a menace at you just now.'</p>

<p>She had stayed the horse. She stood in the
midst of the drove, upright, her foot planted
before her, her head raised, one arm lifted to
the horse's head, the other extended before her
with hand outspread. She had nothing on her
head save her chestnut hair flying in the cold
north wind. Her side-turned face was colourless
and sallow.</p>

<p>'Come, Ki Drownlands. When I make an
offer, I mean it. When I make a threat, I mean
that too. Will you take my offer? It is not
Cheap Jack Zita who will go back from her
word.'</p>

<p>'Be it so, then.'</p>

<p>'It is a deal?'</p>

<p>'Yes—a bargain.'</p>

<p>'Here is my hand,' said Zita, dropping the
bridle. 'A deal is a deal.'</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">IN COURT</p>

<p class="p1">A FEW days were allowed to pass to obtain
fresh captures. On a keen, frosty morning,
those taken by the constable and the
military, to the number of nearly forty persons,
were brought before the magistrates for the
preliminary examination. It had been resolved
that a Special Commission should be appointed
to try the prisoners on the capital charges of
burglary, arson, robbery, and tumultuous assembling
to the disturbance of the peace, and the
commission of acts of violence. The object of
the magistrates on the present occasion was
to sift the cases, and deal at once with those
of a light nature, and remand such as were
serious.</p>

<p>The magistrates were in force at the courthouse,
and proceedings had begun before Ki
Drownlands arrived in a light gig, with Zita at
his side.</p>

<p>On reaching the court, the girl was surprised

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>

to see a constable issue from the door, and in
loud tones call the name of Ephraim Beamish.</p>

<p>'Well,' said she, 'those magistrates must be a
set of innocents if they order Pip to be summoned
in the streets of Ely. Do they suppose
he would come here to be caught? Pip will put
his distance between himself and the magistrates,
as he did t'other day when the dragoons were
on the drove. He did not stay for them then,
and he won't come for the calling now.'</p>

<p>On entering the court Zita looked about her.
She was affected with a qualm of nervousness,
and her colour was heightened. She had never
been in a court of justice before; but when she
discovered that the hall was crowded, she held
up her head, breathed freely, and her spirits recovered
their elasticity.</p>

<p>'It's my own general public again,' said she;
'I am not afraid any more.'</p>

<p>'Ephraim Beamish makes no answer to his
name,' said the clerk of the court.</p>

<p>'We will proceed with the case against
Ephraim Beamish,' said the chairman; 'and
the Bench hopes that the constables will not
be remiss in their duty, nor relax their efforts
to obtain possession of his body, and lodge
him in prison—that is, should his case be
proved.'</p>

<p>The evidence produced did satisfy the Bench
that Beamish should be remitted to the hands
of the Special Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mark Runham was called, and at once
placed in the dock.</p>

<p>Zita looked at him. She could see that he
was not altogether confident that his innocence
would be acknowledged. He strove to disguise
his anxiety, but ineffectually. He was bewildered
at the charge laid against him, and
troubled at finding himself in a novel and
unpleasant situation.</p>

<p>The depositions having been read over,
Hezekiah Drownlands, of Prickwillow, was
ordered to stand in the witness-box, for it was
he who had lodged information against Mark.</p>

<p>Zita immediately elbowed her way to the
front, and, resting her elbow on the rail that
limited the portion of the court accessible to
the public, looked steadily into the face of the
master. She was resolved to check and correct
his statements, so that they should not tell unfavourably
against the prisoner. Drownlands
noticed her, but refrained from meeting her
eye. He gave his evidence with hesitation
and confusedly, for he had laid information
against Mark Runham, and was now seeking
to minimise the charge and weaken the force
of his own accusations.</p>

<p>'I was in my office,' said Drownlands, 'on that
same evening, and was talking with—with Zita
there,'—he pointed with his thumb towards the
girl, but without looking at her,—'when I heard
the voices of the rioters.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>'Stay a moment,' said the chairman, interposing.
'Who may this Zita be?'</p>

<p>The chairman was a merry, red-faced man, a
gentleman who had been brother to a former
Dean, and had obtained from that Dean a lease
of a large tract of ecclesiastical property for
ninety-nine years at a nominal rent, and who
resided and had become wealthy in Ely.</p>

<p>'I refer,' said Drownlands, 'to that young
woman. She lives in my house.'</p>

<p>The eyes of the Bench and of the audience
were directed towards the girl.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the chairman. 'Rather young for
a housekeeper, eh?'</p>

<p>'She is not my housekeeper.'</p>

<p>'In what capacity, then, may we regard her
as residing with you?'</p>

<p>Drownlands hesitated.</p>

<p>'Come, come! Don't be reticent, Mr. Drownlands.'</p>

<p>'I really cannot say.'</p>

<p>'Shall we say she is a sort of—ahem—companion?'</p>

<p>A titter ran through the court.</p>

<p>'I am a lodger,' said Zita. 'I pay my way.'</p>

<p>'Silence!' ordered the chief constable.</p>

<p>'You shall speak in your turn,' said the chairman,
'and no doubt you will be able to give us
valuable evidence, but you must not interrupt,
you understand.' Then, turning to the witness,
and chuckling and becoming purple with his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>

suppressed laughter, the chairman said, 'Very
well, Mr. Drownlands, go on. We commend your
taste. You were talking with your pretty companion,
or lodger.'</p>

<p>A laugh ran through the court, in which all
joined save the clerical members of the bench,
who looked grave and shook their heads.</p>

<p>Zita coloured, and looked about her angrily.
Mark's face was pale, and his eyes were lowered.</p>

<p>'I was talking with her in my office,' continued
Drownlands, 'when the mob entered my stackyard
with torches, and threatened to burn my
ricks and break into my house. Mark Runham
was with them.'</p>

<p>'Did he threaten you?'</p>

<p>'A great many voices were raised. I could
not distinguish one from another. There was
a waggon, and Aaron Chevell, Harry Tansley,
and Isaac Harley were in it, and Tansley held
a gun.'</p>

<p>'Never mind about Tansley now. I see in
your deposition that Mark Runham entered
your house. Was it so?'</p>

<p>'Yes. He came to my door and knocked.
Then Zita let him in.'</p>

<p>'But,' interrupted the chairman, 'what you
say now, witness, is not in agreement with your
information. You deposed that he had feloniously
entered your house.'</p>

<p>'He came to ask for money.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that may be; but if he knocked and was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>

admitted, he cannot be said to have feloniously
entered your premises.'</p>

<p>'I don't know about that. I gave no orders
that he should be let in. She took it on herself,
and went down and unbarred the door, and
brought him up to the office. When there he
asked for money—for twenty pounds.'</p>

<p>'No, gentlemen,'exclaimed Zita, 'it was not
so. He told the master that he advised him to
pay the money lest the men should do mischief.
He asked for nothing.'</p>

<p>'Silence, if you please,' said the chairman;
'your turn will come presently, and then we will
listen to your story. Proceed, Mr. Drownlands.
You say now that Mark Runham, the accused,
was let into your house by the pretty companion—or
lodger. He did not break in. The information
is incorrect.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand lawyers' jargon,' said
Drownlands sullenly. 'All I know is that Mark
Runham came in and asked for twenty pounds,
and said that if I did not pay it, the men would
burn my ricks as they had those of Gaultrip.
I know that blows were struck at my door, and
I heard threats that the men would break in,
and a brick was thrown at me through the
window.'</p>

<p>'That took place whilst Mark was in the room,'
said Zita.</p>

<p>'Silence there!' shouted the constable.</p>

<p>'If that girl will intervene, and will not be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>

quiet, let her be put out of the court,' said Sir
Bates Dudley, who was on the bench.</p>

<p>'I'll be quiet,' said Zita; 'but when one hears
lies, it is hard not to contradict—it is hard—tremenjous.'</p>

<p>'Go on, Mr. Drownlands,' said the chairman.</p>

<p>'They threatened, if I would not pay the
twenty pounds, that they would burst in at the
door, or by the windows, and take two hundred.'</p>

<p>'Who? The accused?'</p>

<p>'No, not the accused; the others. He was
in my office, speaking with me.'</p>

<p>'But we do not want to hear what the others
said—at least not now. We are considering the
case of Mark Runham. He is a farmer—a
landowner, I believe?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he is.'</p>

<p>'And you think it likely that such an one
would put himself at the head of a lawless rabble,
to wreck farms and extort money from his
fellow-landowners?'</p>

<p>'He demanded twenty pounds of me.'</p>

<p>'Well, go on with your story. You refused
the money?'</p>

<p>'I did so at first, but in the end I was forced
to pay it.'</p>

<p>'Forced? Did the prisoner employ violence?'</p>

<p>'No; the rabble outside threatened to burn all
down unless I paid. I put the money into the
prisoner's hand.'</p>

<p>'After that he left your house?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>'He took ten pounds also from Zita.'</p>

<p>'No; I offered them to him to save my van!'
exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>'Another word of interruption, and you are
turned out of court,' said the chairman. 'Constable,
stand by her, and if she opens her mouth
again, clap your hand over it, or stuff your
pocket-handkerchief down her throat.'</p>

<p>'I will do so, your worship.'</p>

<p>'That is all you have to say, witness?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I have nothing more, except that
Runham gave cake and ale to the rioters.'</p>

<p>'You saw him do so?'</p>

<p>'No. I heard he had regaled them.'</p>

<p>'That is no evidence.' Then the chairman
turned to Mark Runham and said, 'Has the
accused any questions he would like to put to
witness?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mark. 'I inquire of him whether
I did not protest that I came merely as a
neighbour and a friend.'</p>

<p>'A friend?' exclaimed Drownlands. 'No
Runham can be a friend to me, nor I a friend
to him.'</p>

<p>'That is no answer to his question,' said the
chairman.</p>

<p>'He said something of the sort,' Drownlands
admitted.</p>

<p>'Did I not say,' pursued Mark, 'that Gaultrip
had refused at the outset to pay blackmail, and
that in the end, when his rick was blazing, he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>

gave way, and that I had run on ahead to advise
you as a neighbour not to provoke to outrage
an irritated and unreasonable rabble?'</p>

<p>'Yes, you said that; but how was I to know
you were not acting for the rioters? You gave
them cake.'</p>

<p>'Come,' said the magistrate occupying the
chair, 'we will hear now what that lively young
woman has to say. She clearly is bursting with
desire to tell us all she knows. Put her in the
witness-box.'</p>

<p>As Drownlands left the place he had occupied,
Zita stepped into his room at the instigation of
the constable. She looked up at the Bench with
a cheery countenance, and then round at the
public that crammed every available space.</p>

<p>'Your name?'</p>

<p>'Zita.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that is well enough as far as it goes,
but we want your surname also.'</p>

<p>'Father said we were Greenways. But nobody
never called him nothing but "Cheap Jack."'</p>

<p>'And your profession or calling? A companion?'</p>

<p>The court tittered. A clown in the public
portion of the hall guffawed.</p>

<p>Zita raised herself erect and said, 'A Cheap
Jack.'</p>

<p>'A Cheap Jill, I should say,' observed the red-faced
chairman, laughing at his own feeble joke,
whereupon the Bench smiled, the clerk of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>

court and the constables laughed, and the public
roared.</p>

<p>The magistrate went on, 'If you are a Cheap
Jack or Jill, how come you to be at Mr. Drownlands'
house? Is your father with you?'</p>

<p>'My father is dead,' replied Zita. 'That is
just why I am at Prickwillow.'</p>

<p>'Then I presume you are a roving Jill in
quest of a Jack?'</p>

<p>'It is the place of the Jacks to run after the
Jills,' said Zita; 'not that I want one, thank
you.'</p>

<p>'Hush! Hush! No impertinence to the
Bench.'</p>

<p>'Beg pardon, I thought the impertinence came
from the Bench to me.'</p>

<p>The sally produced some merriment. When
it was subdued, the magistrate in the chair
assumed a grave manner, and inquired in a
different tone—</p>

<p>'So you are staying at Mr. Drownlands' house?
In what capacity?'</p>

<p>'I am a Cheap Jack,' said Zita. 'I have my
van there, and horse, and all my goods. We
got stuck in the mud of the droves, when on our
way to Littleport, the night of Tawdry Fair.
Father was took ill and died. So I am lodging
at Prickwillow, and I pay for my lodging in
blacking-brushes and slop-pails.'</p>

<p>'You are not, then, in any menial capacity—not
receiving wages?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am a Cheap Jack, laid by the heels through
mud and frost,' answered Zita. 'It is true I
have sewn on some buttons for Master Drownlands,
and have hemmed the linen, and he gives
me house-room for my van and me and the
horse, till the dry weather comes and we can
move away.'</p>

<p>'Well, enough of that. Tell us what you
know about the events of the sixteenth.'</p>

<p>'First of aw—aw—all,' interposed Sir Bates
Dudley, who sat on the right of the chairman.
'She has been put on her oath. Had we not
bet—tet—tet—er ascertain if she is aware of
the nature of an oath?'</p>

<p>'Ah, to be sure! I suppose you were brought
up as a Cheap Jack?'</p>

<p>'Always—since I was a baby.'</p>

<p>'And not in the most virtuous and godly
manner, I fear?'</p>

<p>'I beg pardon, sir?'</p>

<p>Here the constable interposed. He stooped
and said in Zita's ear, 'Address the Bench as
"your worships."'</p>

<p>'I beg pardon, your worships. My father
brought me up. There was not a better man
anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Then—do you understand the nature of an
oath?'</p>

<p>'Father didn't swear but very little—off an'
on like—and mostly at Jewel, who was sometimes
very provoking. But nothing like the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>

man with the merry-go-round—he swore
awful.'</p>

<p>'I do not mean that. Do you comprehend
that you have solemnly promised to speak the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
and that you have called Heaven to witness that
it is so?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Zita, with a sigh; 'but it is hard—tremenjous.'</p>

<p>'What?—hard to speak the truth?'</p>

<p>'Yes, your worship—because of the general
public. You never was a Cheap Jack, was you,
your worship?'</p>

<p>'No. Oh dear no, never—never!'</p>

<p>'I thought so. I never saw you at any of the
fairs, but there was a man who swallowed knives
like that gentleman at your side.'</p>

<p>'Never mind about that.'</p>

<p>'I was going to say, sir, that as you never was
a Cheap Jack, you can't understand what the
feelings of one is, when she sees the general
public afore her eyes. There comes a sort of
swelling of the heart, and a desire of the mind
to launch out into wonderful tales, and a longing
to make the General Jackass believe that black is
white, and chalk is cheese, that what is broken
is sound, and what is old is new. But I will do
my best. I'll shut my eyes and try to forget the
general public, and fancy I'm with father in the
van, for then I always said straight out what
was true.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The winter sun streamed in at the south
window over against Zita and flooded her as she
stood in the witness-box. She had a scarlet and
yellow flowered kerchief round her neck and
over her shoulders, the white chip bonnet with
black ribbons hardly contained her luxuriant,
shining hair. The sun blazed in her face,
flushing her ripe cheeks, making very June
cherries of her lips, and adding a solar twinkle
to the sparkle of intelligence and wit indwelling
in her honest but roguish eyes. She stood as
upright as a wand, her hands resting on the rail
before her, and her head thrown back.</p>

<p>The chairman bent to Sir Bates Dudley and
whispered—</p>

<p>'What a good-looking wench it is!'</p>

<p>'Is she, indeed?' said the canon. 'You don't
mean to say so.'</p>

<p>It did not comport with ecclesiastical, certainly
not with canonical, decorum and dignity to
know whether a girl were good-looking or not.</p>

<p>The chairman turned to the magistrate on his
left and made the same remark. This magistrate
was a layman, a retired admiral, who had
come to live in Ely because his daughter was
married to an official there. His name was
Abbott. There was no etiquette in Her Majesty's
Navy against observing good looks. He replied,
'Thunderingly so, Christian.'</p>

<p>Christian was the chairman's name.</p>

<p>'I'll speak the truth,' said Zita; 'though it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>

is against nature—just as it was against nature
for that little fat gentleman to ride yesterday;
but he did it, because he ought.'</p>

<p>A roar of laughter at the expense of Sir Bates
Dudley.</p>

<p>'Go on,' said the chairman, hardly controlling
himself—the lay members of the Bench loved to
have a joke at the expense of the clerical
members. 'Tell your story, and tell it truthfully,
or you'll get yourself into difficulties.'</p>

<p>'I mean to,' said Zita.</p>

<p>Then she gave the narrative of the events of
the evening of the riot in their order, with such
lucidity and simplicity, and so frankly, that the
truth of her story was stamped on every sentence.
Now and then some odd remark, some allusion
to her van or goods, or to the horse, provoked
a laugh, and she kept Bench and public in good
humour.</p>

<p>'I really think,' said Mr. Christian, 'that we
may dismiss the case against young Runham.
If my brother magistrates agree with me'—He
looked round and met with nods of approval.
'The charge against Mark Runham seems to be
a mistake. There is actually nothing in it, and
the Bench sincerely regrets that, through a misunderstanding,
and possibly through an excess
of zeal on the part of Mr. Drownlands, you,
Mark Runham, should have been placed in the
position you have. Constable, discharge him.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, gents,' said Zita. 'You've done

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>

right, and I'm glad of it. As I came here, I
heard that you had given orders for Pip to be
called. I did think you then a set of ninnies—but
now'—</p>

<p>'That will do. You can leave the witness-box.'</p>

<p>'No, sir—your worship, not yet. I have not
quite said all I want to say. I am very much
obliged that you have listened to reason and
have let Mark go. And, your worships, there
are six of you on the bench. I have got just
six toasting-forks in stock—the beautifullest
toasting-forks that ever you saw. They have
red japanned handles and brass mounts, and
fold up small, like telescopes, into the handle.
And if your worships will do me the favour of
coming to Prickwillow, I'll furnish every one of
you with a toasting-fork.'</p>

<p>'That will do; leave the witness-box.'</p>

<p>'And, your worships, if you will pass over
poor Pip Beamish,—he's not right in his head,—I'll
let you have a real epergne to raffle for
between you.'</p>

<p>'Constable, remove that girl. Turn her out
of the court,' ordered the chairman, red with
laughter.</p>

<p>'I pity the man she chooses as her husband,'
said Christian behind his hand to Abbott, when
his order was being carried out.</p>

<p>'Or Drownlands, whose companion she is,'
whispered the admiral.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>

'No—hang it!' said Mr. Christian. 'No
more of that. I am sure that girl is as straight
as a whistle. You cannot look in her honest
face and hear her cheery voice and not swear she
is as good and clean as gold. 'Pon my life,
Abbott, I have a mind to go for my toasting-fork.
What say you? You are an old acquaintance,
as you heard,—swallowed knives at the
fair,—will you go?'</p>

<p class="center">PISGAH</p>

<p class="p1">ZITA was standing in the room Drownlands
called his office, in conversation with the
master.</p>

<p>'What did you mean by that which you said
to the magistrates—that you were tied here by
frost, held by mud, and that when frost went
and mud dried you would be free to go?'</p>

<p>'It is so.'</p>

<p>'You will leave me?'</p>

<p>'I would go as soon as the van could roll
along the drove,' replied Zita, 'but that there
are other difficulties than frost and mud, and
how to get out of these I do not as yet see. I
work at them in my head, but cannot find a way
of escape.' She considered a while, with her
hands folded and her eyes on the floor. 'You
see, there is the stock. It seems sinful to let
it lie idle—if it don't breed money, it will breed
moths and rust. Father always said money was
made to jump—just the same as frogs were so

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>

created. Here is all this store of goods doing
nothing. Here is myself—born a Cheap Jack,
and a Cheap Jack to my fingers' ends. I am
not in my right place if not going about in my
van to fairs and markets, selling my goods, and
making the money jump, as it was ordained to.'
Zita pursed her lips. 'That is on one side. On
the other there are considerations also. In the
first place, it is awkward for a young girl to be
cheap-jacking over the country—it's awkward,
and it's not respectable. She cannot manage
by herself. As the gentleman said, a Jill must
have a Jack. That was true, though I did not
like to hear him say it. I could not manage
the van and Jewel and the selling alone. I
must have some man with me. And if I were
to take a servant, he might set his head to make
himself Jack and make me Jill. And to take a
proper Jack,' pursued Zita,—'I mean, to have a
husband,—why, I don't fancy it. I don't like
the notion of it at all. There is my great
difficulty.'</p>

<p>'Then stay at Prickwillow.'</p>

<p>'I don't know. If I were here, you would not
leave me in peace and quietness. I do not
desire to remain here, but I do not know where
else to go. Now, you see, I am in a cleft
stick.'</p>

<p>'Take me, and remain.'</p>

<p>'That, I have told you, can never be. If you
ask that again, I will go. If you say nought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>

about it, I will make shift to stay till something
turns up.'</p>

<p>'Till you find a Jack?'</p>

<p>'I do not want a Jack. I said so. I want to
remain free—Jack and Jill all in one.' Her
expression suddenly changed as she asked,
'Have they taken Pip Beamish yet?'</p>

<p>'No; he has been seen, but he eluded capture.
He is in the Fens. He has some hiding-place,
but where it is we have not yet discovered.
The constables are out and watching. He
cannot leave the Fens.'</p>

<p>'Cannot? He escaped the dragoons. He
has escaped the constables, as you tell me now.'</p>

<p>'Ah! the dragoons were not accustomed to
fen ways. The constables will take him. They
will form a ring and close in. There is a reward
for whoever takes him, and I have added five
guineas.'</p>

<p>'And I will give ten to any constable who
lets him slip through his fingers. Publish
that.'</p>

<p>'We have had enough of Ephraim Beamish,'
said the master. 'We were speaking about ourselves.
You have your difficulties and troubles,
but I also have mine.'</p>

<p>Drownlands seated himself at the table, placed
his arms on the board, and for a moment rested
his head on his folded arms. Then he looked
up and said—</p>

<p>'I have my distresses, but they are of other

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>

nature to yours, and different in degree. Do
you know Scripture? Did your father ever
read the Bible to you?'</p>

<p>'My father was a God-fearing man,' answered
Zita, with warmth and pride. 'He made me
learn passages by heart, and there was one tale
he read over every Sunday, and never tired of
it. It was how the Israelites borrowed of the
Egyptians jewels of silver and gold, and spoiled
the Egyptians, then went off and got the
Egyptians drowned, and so were able to keep
their borrowings. Father said there was the
making of Cheap Jacks in them Israelites.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever read of Moses, how he went up
the mountain to view the Promised Land,—the
land flowing with milk and honey,—and he
looked on it from afar, but was never allowed
to set foot thereon? And he died there, in the
mount. The wind came to him sweet with
thyme, and he saw the green cattle pastures by
the waters of comfort, but he might not drink of
its milk or eat its honey. And he died there,
looking at the land that was so near and yet so
far, a land he might see, but never set foot on.
He died there, for it broke his heart.'</p>

<p>Drownlands laid his head again on his folded
arms. Zita remained in the same position.
She had an inkling of his drift, and was uneasy,
and cast about for some means of relief from a
painful scene.</p>

<p>'I suppose,' she said, 'there were fine bargains

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>

to be driven in the Promised Land, and that the
Canaanites were as soft-headed as the Egyptians.
To a man of proper feeling it was vexing.'</p>

<p>Drownlands paid no attention to the remark.
He continued—</p>

<p>'Do you remember why Moses was not
suffered to go in and possess the Good Land?
There was something betwixt him and it. He
had done that which was against the law, therefore
the Lord showed him the fields of Canaan,
but said he must never lay his head in the dewy
grass, never smell its upturned earth, never
touch its fair flowers.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I remember something about it,' said
Zita.</p>

<p>'What killed Moses was the seeing the land,
and being told it never might be his,' continued
Drownlands. 'But he could not go back from
Pisgah into the wilderness. He could not turn
his back on Canaan. He must sit among the
rocks, and look on the pleasant land, till his
heart broke, and he died.'</p>

<p>The girl fixed her eyes on the quivering face
of Drownlands. She saw that he was in terrible
earnest, and she did not see her way out of an
embarrassing situation. He spoke again.</p>

<p>'Zita, do you think it would have been wise
for Joshua to have come up into Pisgah when
Moses was there? Would not Moses have
sprung up and cried out, "This man will enter
on what is denied me!" and have held him by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>

the throat?' Drownlands was now on his feet,
his hands extended before him, suiting his
action to his words. 'He would have held him
by the throat, have thrown him on a rock, put
his knee to his chest, and bent his back so—and
have broken his back.'</p>

<p>As he spoke, he hit and split and crushed
down half the table. Then he drew a long
inhalation, reseated himself, wiped his brow,
and said—</p>

<p>'There is no Joshua. You swore to me there
was none.'</p>

<p>'I think I can comprehend this roundabout
talk,' said Zita. 'But if you mean that I am
your Promised Land, you are mistaken. I
never was promised to you.'</p>

<p>'No, that is true; you are the Loved Land,
the Desired Land. No, you never were
promised.'</p>

<p>'And it is quite certain that I am not for
you.'</p>

<p>'I know it.'</p>

<p>'And I will trouble you to keep your Pisgah
at a distance, and stick to it,' said Zita.</p>

<p>'You have told me that you never can be
mine, and you have told me also why. My sin
stands between us, as a sin stood between
Moses and Canaan. And yet—I would do it
again if I met him. You do not know how
Runham wronged me; you have never learned
what was my provocation. I pay the penalty

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>

of my sin, as did Moses. That very night I
killed him—that very same night, not two
minutes after the last bubbles came from his
lips—I first saw you. The punishment followed
on the crime faster than the thunder-clap after
the lightning-flash. Well, then, so long as you
remain before my eyes, that I can see your
golden hair, and hear your lark-like voice, I am
content. I have all I can expect. I will try to
be content. But I could not endure to have a
Joshua near me.'</p>

<p>'There is none—if you mean a Jack.'</p>

<p>'I trust your word. Mark Runham is nothing
to you?'</p>

<p>'I am nothing to Mark,' said Zita, with slight
evasion. 'He would not even look at me in
court.'</p>

<p>'So long as you remain here, I will bear my
burden, though it break my heart, bit by bit.
But that is better than to lose you altogether.
No'—he stood up again, went to the window,
leaned his arm and head against the shattered
casement, and let the wind blow in on him
through the broken glass—'no, that I can bear—to
have you here. But to lose you—to see
you no more—I cannot even endure to think of
that.'</p>

<p>Zita made a movement to escape. He heard
her, and, without turning his head, made a sign
to her with his hand to stay.</p>

<p>'Do not leave me. I have still something I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>

must say. I want to strike a bargain with
you.'</p>

<p>'A deal? I am ready.'</p>

<p>Zita resumed her place. Drownlands came
slowly back to the table.</p>

<p>'Listen to me,' he said, with a thrill in his
deep tones. 'I have made up my mind to this—that
<em>his</em> blood lies between me and you, as
a Dead Sea I may never cross. I must sit
on my Pisgah and look at you as unapproachable.
That is all I can hope for; that is all I
demand; and in order to secure this, I am ready
to make you an offer. I shall never marry—never.
All the land round Prickwillow is mine,
and I have money in the bank—many thousands
of pounds. You know what money is worth.
You can judge what this land brings in every
year to heap the pile. It shall all be yours if
you will stay with me till I die. I ask for
nothing else but to have you here in this house,
that I may hear you laugh, that I may see your
smiling face. That is all. I will not open my
mouth to ask for anything but that—just to see
you and hear you every day; now and then to
touch your hand; happy, if as you pass me
your skirts brush me; glad for a day if you
condescend to cast a word at me. That is all—the
full, the sum of all. And for that I will pay
away everything I have. Command me. Do
with me what you please, only do not banish
me. My money is at your disposal, and when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>

I die everything that I have becomes yours.
See here.' He went to his desk, unlocked it,
and drew forth a paper. 'I have made my will,
but it is not yet signed and attested. It could
not be so till we had come to an arrangement
together. If you will undertake to remain with
me on the terms I propose, then you will be a
wealthy woman some day when I am gone.
And whilst I am here cumbering the place,'—his
tone was bitter,—'you have but to ask and I
will give you what you require. Agree with me,
and this document shall be signed and attested
forthwith. For a very slight concession on your
part you will receive a rich repayment. As you
said, you could not go about the country in your
van, and you have no settled home to which you
can go. Surely you will concede this to me.'</p>

<p>He placed the paper on the table before Zita.</p>

<p>She took up the will and read it through.</p>

<p>In few words, and to the point, Drownlands
had constituted her sole heir and legatee to
everything he possessed, on the one condition
that she remained in his house through the rest
of his life.</p>

<p>She put the paper down on the table again,
without, however, releasing it from her hand,
and stood considering.</p>

<p>'There is one thing,' she said, after a long
pause, 'one thing I must stick out for whether
I stay here for a short time or for long.'</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>'That you board up the shed where my van
is kept, so that the fowls may not roost on it.'</p>

<p>Then in at the door came Mrs. Tunkiss.</p>

<p>'There's Mark Runham come,' she said to
the master, after looking suspiciously first at
Zita, then at him. 'And he says he must speak
with you on business.'</p>

<p>'Mark?—Mark again? Bring him here. I
am not afraid of him now. Come, Zita, what
say you to my offer?'</p>

<p>For a few moments she remained with her
hand to her head, breathing hard, her eyes
dim.</p>

<p>'Come, Zita—what answer?'</p>

<p>She looked at him with glazed eyes. She
was in pain and sorrow. She would in one
moment see Mark,—Mark, whom she loved,—and
see him with the knowledge that she never
could be his. But the demand made of her to
surrender was not so great as it might have
been had Mark loved and respected her. He
liked, or had once liked her. Now he loved
another. He despised her for some reason she
could not understand. He held by Kainie, to
whom he was bound by promise, and to whom,
after a short wavering of his affections, he had
returned.</p>

<p>'Come, Zita, what say you to my offer?'</p>

<p>In a whisper, with sunk head, her chin in her
bosom, and with folded hands—</p>

<p>'I accept.'</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A PARTHIAN SHOT</p>

<p class="p1">'SHALL I go?' asked Zita.</p>

<p>'No, stay. There can nothing pass
betwixt us but what you may hear. And now
that he is come, he shall witness the signature to
the will.'</p>

<p>'I would rather leave.'</p>

<p>Further discussion of this point was prevented
by the entrance of Mark.</p>

<p>The young man noticed that Zita was in the
room, but he did not look at her or address her.
He directed his eyes steadily at Drownlands,
who remained seated at the table.</p>

<p>'I have come on business,' said Mark.</p>

<p>'Say what it is.'</p>

<p>Mark demurred. 'Let us speak together in
private.'</p>

<p>'No; what has to be said may be said before
her.'</p>

<p>'If you wish it. I have come concerning
Kainie.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>'What about Kainie?'</p>

<p>'She is your niece.'</p>

<p>'To my sorrow.'</p>

<p>'You should not say that. She is a good
girl. Not to your sorrow, but to your shame.'</p>

<p>Drownlands stamped.</p>

<p>'Spare me words. My patience will not
stretch far.'</p>

<p>'Kainie is your sister's only child. She is
your nearest relative. I have come to you in
her interest. It is no longer possible for her to
remain at Red Wings.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'It is not seemly. It is not just. The Fens
are in commotion; wild men are about, lawless
deeds are being done. She is but a girl, and
is unprotected, and away from help, if she
needed it.'</p>

<p>'She has her dog.'</p>

<p>'That is not sufficient. Dogs have been
silenced before now. Consider to what dangers
a girl is exposed in such a solitary spot.'</p>

<p>'Pshaw! the men are cowed.'</p>

<p>'Several are about in hiding, and are not yet
captured. You do a great wrong to Kainie.'</p>

<p>'I do her no wrong. I leave her alone.'</p>

<p>'That in itself is a grievous wrong. Whose
duty is it to guard her, but yours? She bears
your name.'</p>

<p>'To my disgrace!' exclaimed Drownlands,
glaring up with wrath. 'No more of that.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, it is no pleasant topic.'</p>

<p>'Did Kainie send you to me?'</p>

<p>'No; I came because I felt concerned for her,
and convinced that she must not be allowed—no,
not for another night—to remain under the
sails of Red Wings. Will you receive her at
Prickwillow?'</p>

<p>'Not I.'</p>

<p>'She must be removed from the mill. If you
will not take charge of her, then I must.'</p>

<p>'You are welcome. I will have nothing to do
with her.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, so be it. It is your duty to see to
her security. You refuse to do your duty, so I
shall take her. That is settled. Now, one thing
further. Will you make Kainie an allowance,—something
to support her,—even if you refuse her
shelter?'</p>

<p>'Not a penny. I washed my hands of her
mother, and I wash my hands of her.'</p>

<p>'I feared this would be your answer,' said
Mark, and drew a long breath. 'I feared my
application to you would be in vain. Nevertheless,
I considered myself bound to make it; I
could not act till you had refused to act; much
as did Boaz when troubled concerning Ruth.
You finally refuse to give protection to Kainie
in her loneliness, and at this season of danger?'</p>

<p>'Ay, I do.'</p>

<p>'And refuse to furnish her with even a
pittance out of your abundance?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ay, I do.'</p>

<p>'You should blush to deny her what she
needs.'</p>

<p>'I blush for her being in the world at all.'</p>

<p>Mark turned to go. Then Drownlands spoke
out in strong tones—</p>

<p>'Stay! Now that you are here, I ask you to
do me a favour. It is not much—merely to
witness a document, to attest my signature to
my will. I desire you to see me sign that, and
it will be the best answer I can make to your
application on behalf of Kainie. Zita, call up
Leehanna Tunkiss.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Tunkiss was behind the door. She had
been listening in the passage, and now appeared
in the doorway, after a short scuffle of feet, to
give a semblance of her having come from a
distance.</p>

<p>'Do you want me, master?' she asked. 'I
was in the midst of baking.'</p>

<p>'Stand there,' ordered Drownlands. Then,
rising to his feet, he held up the will and said,
'I have been making my last testament, and
I desire that you, Mark Runham, and you,
Leehanna Tunkiss, should see me sign it. But
that will not suffice. I wish you to know its
contents, and then there can be no question
relative to its genuineness; and, above all, no
delusions, no hopes, no schemes can be based
on relationship, fancied or real, that are doomed
to disappointment.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Drownlands looked round him. He saw a
flicker in Leehanna's eye. She was akin to him
distantly, yet really.</p>

<p>'Zita and I have come to an understanding
together,' said the yeoman, in articulate words
spoken slowly. 'Zita has promised that she
will remain with me, and will look after my
house, rule over my servants, attend to my
comforts as long as I live. If you, Leehanna,
choose to remain with this understanding'—</p>

<p>'I shall do no such thing,' said the housekeeper,
tossing her head. 'I thought matters
would come to this very quickly. I knew what
the minx was aiming at.'</p>

<p>'That is your affair,' said the master. 'Zita
stays here, and her word is to be law in my
house. I have made my will, and leave to her
everything I possess—every brick of my house,
every clod of my soil, every guinea of my hoard.'
He paused, and looked from one to another.
Mark and Leehanna remained mute with astonishment.
'Now go, Mark Runham, as soon as
you have attested my signature, and tell Kainie
she has nothing to expect from me at present,
nor in times to come—nothing from Drownlands
living, or Drownlands dead. Let this be
known throughout the Fens. Mark Runham,
stand here and witness me sign my name. This
is my true act and deed.'</p>

<p>'I will not do this,' said the young man,
turning white. 'Get some one else to see this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>

done—this that stamps her infamy and your
baseness.' He turned sharply about and went
through the door. Then he halted for a moment,
hesitated, holding the jamb with one hand, and,
looking back with a face devoid of colour, said,
'To-night I shall fetch Kainie away, and she
shall find her home with me.'</p>

<p>'Mark!' exclaimed Zita, running to him.</p>

<p>'Stand back!' said he roughly. 'Do not
come near me; you, who sell yourself body and
soul for what you call profits.'</p>

<p>Then he turned and staggered down the stairs.</p>

<p>'And I give notice that I leave this house
at once,' said Mrs. Tunkiss. 'Fine goings on
these be. I have ever kept myself respectable.
I've been the only respectable woman here
besides Sarah. I'm not going to stay in this
house, which will be avoided by every decent
woman, with a man that will be pointed at by
every decent man, with her in it as missus—as
missus'—</p>

<p>The woman laughed bitterly, tauntingly, and
threw a foul name in the face of Zita, and then
backed, with a sneer on her lips and hate in her
eyes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">PURGATORY</p>

<p class="p1">SUDDENLY, and for the first time, did the
thought flare through Zita's brain and
scorch it—that she had compromised her
character.</p>

<p>Now only did she see why Mark had refused
to look at her; now only understand what he
meant when he said that she had sold herself
body and soul; now only comprehended what
the laughter signified when the chairman in
court had suggested that she was the 'companion'
of Drownlands, a suggestion which had
been received with titters. She remembered
how then her brow had become hot, her heart
had beat fast; she was sensible that something
had been said that hurt her maiden pride, something
that lowered her in the esteem of those
assembled in the court. But she had not
sounded the meaning of the insinuation, and
had not thought what was really the sting in
the words which wounded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Zita possessed a considerable amount of pride—a
different sort of pride, maybe, from any
that we can conceive in our stations in life. It
was not vanity. She concerned herself little
about her personal appearance, and made no
effort by dress to display her beauty. She
knew she was a good-looking girl, and was
indifferent to the fact. She had no education
of the sort which we prize; but she had stood
on platforms, her feet level with the shoulders
of the general public, and she had come,
instinctively, without being able to account to
herself for it, to regard herself as possessing a
character, a dignity of her own above that which
belonged to the members of the general public.
She who stood above it actually must live up to
her level, and stand above it in moral strength
and integrity.</p>

<p>Zita had a simple and innocent mind. She
had been reared in a van, had led a rambling
life, her sole associate had been a father—a
kindly man, gentle, good after his lights, and
very careful of her welfare. The fact of her
having been shifted perpetually from place to
place had prevented her forming associates,
making fast friendships, so that she had really
had none to affect her mind save her father, and
had grown to womanhood a singular combination
of shrewdness and simplicity. Thus her heart
was fresh and childlike, whilst her brain was
keen in all that concerned commerce. She had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>

been carefully screened by the Cheap Jack father
from everything that could taint the sweetness
of her innocence and sully the crystalline purity
of her mind.</p>

<p>There was one thing she had never learned
from her father, one thing of which till this
moment she had no conception—the power of
public opinion. She had acquired in her
vagrant life an idea that the general public was
a something to be laughed at and laughed with,
that was to be humoured, cajoled, befooled; but
it had never been suspected by her that the
public could utter its voice and make the heart
quake, breathe on and blast a reputation, could
bite and poison the blood.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly, a veil was lifted, and she saw
the general public in a new light, and felt the
terrible power over her life and happiness that
it exercised.</p>

<p>No man is so free as the man without a home.
If he has committed an indiscretion, he pulls up
his tent-pegs, moves away, and is forgotten.
But a man who remains on the scene of his
indiscretion is haunted by it ever after. The
remembrance clings to him as the shirt of
Nessus. It is never forgotten, never forgiven.
As long as the van crawled over the face of
the country, changing the atmosphere that
surrounded it, it eluded the force of public
opinion. Its inmates paid no tax to it; were
not registered on its books. But hardly had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>

Zita become settled before its burden fell upon
her.</p>

<p>'Unsay what you have said!' cried Zita,
grasping Mrs. Tunkiss by the arm.</p>

<p>'It is true. It is what every one has been
saying; and, as you see, Mark Runham won't
have anything to do with you. You thought to
catch him, did you? You've been angling for
him and the master, and taken the one as bids
highest. 'Tis like a Cheap Jack that. You're
young, but bold as brass and cankered as
iron.'</p>

<p>'Silence, you false-mouthed woman!'</p>

<p>'Can you silence all the tongues in the Fen?
There's not a man over his pipe and ale in the
tavern ain't jeering at you. There's not a
woman over her soapsuds and scrubbing-brush
ain't crying shame on you. But what can you
expect of a vagabond but vice? I spit at
you.'</p>

<p>Zita cast the woman from her, and turned and
threw herself on her knees at the broken table,
buried her face in her hands, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Drownlands waved imperiously to the housekeeper
to leave, and the woman withdrew,
muttering and casting malignant glances at the
broken, prostrate girl.</p>

<p>The table was between the master of Prickwillow
and Zita. His knuckles rested on the
will. He leaned on them, and looked down on
the shining head that was laid low before him.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>

Zita's hair was cut short, and her neck showed
as well as her rounded cheek.</p>

<p>He did not speak. He breathed heavily
through his distended nostrils. He waited, not
knowing what direction her thoughts might take,
what resolve her mind would form.</p>

<p>There were but few alternatives among which
she might choose. She could not resume her
life as Cheap Jack without taking an assistant,
and from that course she shrank with maidenly
repugnance, rightly estimating its dangers. If
she were to throw herself among the wanderers
who frequented fairs, it would be to court ruin.
Was it not probable that she would maintain
her resolution to remain at Prickwillow, with this
difference, that she would accept his first offer,
and become his wife, to save her fair name from
reproach? So far as Drownlands could see, this
was the only means whereby she could extricate
herself from her difficulties, and his heart swelled
within him at the hope that opened before him.
But he saw clearly that he must allow her to
work to this solution by herself unassisted. A
word from him would mar everything.</p>

<p>He accordingly stood with bent brows and
pale face, the furrows deeply graven on his
forehead and seaming his cheek, his lips set,
looking steadily at the chestnut-gold head and
the delicate bowed neck.</p>

<p>There is no agony more terrible than the
agony of the soul, and among the many anguishes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>

with which that can be affected none equals in
intensity and poignancy that which is caused by
the sense of the loss of the respect of men.</p>

<p>There was an ineffable humiliation in the
thought of the light in which she—Zita—had
come to be regarded, if what Mrs. Tunkiss said
was true. The girl who errs through over-trust
in a lover, who has believed his word, his oath,
is looked down on, but deserves some pity. But
Zita did not occupy such a position, had not the
same claim to be dealt by lightly. She had—so
men thought, so men said—deliberately and
calculatingly sold herself to Drownlands. Her
degradation had been a piece of sordid merchandise,
with haggling over terms.</p>

<p>That was true which Leehanna said. She
was the subject-matter of talk in the taverns, of
coarse and ribald jokes, of calculation of the
chances she had of retaining the affections of
Drownlands, of remark on her craft, her dexterity
in laying hold of and managing this intractable
tyrant of the Fens.</p>

<p>But perhaps the intensest anguish-point lay
in the thought that Mark, who had loved her, or
liked her—Mark, whom she had loved, whom
she loved still, regarded her with disgust, held
himself aloof from her, as one unworthy even of
his pity, as a cold, calculating wanton.</p>

<p>As all these thoughts passed through the mind
of Zita, the pain was so excessive that she could
have shrieked, and felt relief in shrieking; that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>

she worked with her feet on the planks of the
floor, as though to bore with them a hole down
which she might disappear and hide her shame.</p>

<p>The drops ran off her brow like the drops
on a window after rain—long-gathering trickles
of moisture, then a great drop, immediately
succeeded by another accumulation, and again
another drop. Save for the working of her feet
on the floor and the movement of her fingers,
she was motionless. Drownlands contemplated
her steadily. He saw her, in her anguish of
mind, twine and untwine her long fingers, then
pluck at and strip off chips of the table where
he had broken it, put them between her teeth
and bite them, but still with lowered brow and
eyes that she could not raise for shame. He
could see flushes pass over her, succeeded by
deadly pallor. It was as though flames were
flickering about her head, shooting up and
enveloping throat and cheek and brow, then
dying down and leaving a deathly cold behind.
A soul in this present life was prematurely
suffering its purgatory.</p>

<p>Then she laid her hands flat on the table
before her, then folded them, as children fold
their hands in prayer, and she was still, as though
her pulses had ceased to beat and her lungs to
play. Then again ensued a paroxysm of distress,
in which the fingers writhed and became knotted,
and tears broke from her eyes and sobs from
her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>How long would this last?</p>

<p>What resolutions were forming and unforming
under that crown of shining locks, in that heavily-charged
heart?</p>

<p>The door was thrust open, and in came Sarah,
the maid with St. Vitus' dance.</p>

<p>'Please,' she said, 'there be three gem'men
from Ely downstairs. They say they be come
after their toastin'-forks.'</p>

<p>'Tell them to wait, and I will be down

<p>Drownlands was surprised. The girl had
regained her composure; and from the look of
her face he was assured that she had formed
her resolution.</p>

<p>'That is right,' said he; 'things remain as
arranged.'</p>

<p>'I cannot go away,' said Zita in a low voice.
'Here I am, and here I must remain. If I have
done wrong to stay here, the wrong is done. If
I have been foolish to accept your hospitality,
the folly is past recall.' She looked over her
shoulder to see that Sarah had withdrawn.</p>

<p>'Yes; I promised you I would remain here,
and here I will remain, on a condition.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>He held up the will.</p>

<p>'Yes, on condition that you leave everything
you have as I shall direct.'</p>

<p>'I leave it all to you.'</p>

<p>'The will must be written afresh,' said Zita;
'a change must be made in it. You have
bequeathed everything to me, and because of
that, evil thoughts will rise up in folks' minds,
and evil words will pass over their lips. Even
Mark thinks ill of me. I did not think Mark
could have done that.' She heaved a sigh, and
drew her hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>'Master,' said she, after a pause, 'you had no
right to make that will and leave me all. I am
not your niece. I shall never stand nearer to
you than I do now. I have no claim on your
house or lands. But Kainie has. She is your
own sister's child. You must alter your will
and leave everything to her.'</p>

<p>'I said I would give her nought.'</p>

<p>'And that made Mark believe me to be bad.
I will not have anything of yours. I will have
you make the writing out anew, and bequeath
everything to Kainie—on the same condition,
if you will, that I remain here all your days.
I do not say, Give Kainie everything now. I
have no right to say that. I do not say, Give
me nothing at any time. I shall have a right to
some payment, or some acknowledgment of my
services. But what I do say is that I will not
be your heir hereafter. Kainie has a claim on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>

you that I have not. If I were to be enriched
with house and lands by you, then the evil that
is thought of me would be confirmed. But
folks may say what they will, when, some day,
after you are gone, the property changes hands
and falls to Kainie; they cannot think I have
been so wicked as was supposed. And I shall
have repaid you for your kindness to me, in
that I have saved you from committing a great
injustice. Mark said I would do anything—sell
body and soul—for profit. He will come to
see that he was wrong there.'</p>

<p>Drownlands gazed on the girl with incredulity.
She had hit on an arrangement that had not
suggested itself to his mind. He could not
believe that she was serious in her purpose.</p>

<p>'I will remain with you,' continued Zita, 'on
the clear understanding that Kainie is to be
your heir, and I would wish this understanding
to be generally made known. Some day, when
I am old and ugly, and you are dead and gone,
then, when the new folks come into Prickwillow,
I'll harness the horse and start as a Cheap Jack
once more. Then I can take a man to mind
the horse, when I do the business of a Cheap
Jack. No one can say wrong of me then.
When Mark Runham comes into this place'—</p>

<p>'Mark Runham will never be here.'</p>

<p>'He must be here, if this falls some day to
Kainie.'</p>

<p>'That does not follow.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>'Of course it follows, if he marries Kainie.'</p>

<p>'Mark—marry Kainie? What do you
mean?'</p>

<p>'I told you that Mark would have nothing
more to say to me, because he was bound to
another. I would not say to whom, for that
was his secret. But now he has let it out himself.
He is going to take Kainie home to
Crumbland this evening.'</p>

<p>Drownlands started and threw over a chair.</p>

<p>'You are mistaken. You do not know.' He
paced the room in agitation.</p>

<p>'I do know,' answered Zita. 'It is because
he was bound to Kainie that he gave me up.
Now he is going to take her to him for better
for worse. Lawk! how dull men are in these
matters—where girls see clear.'</p>

<p>'You are greatly mistaken.'</p>

<p>'No, I am not mistaken. How can you fail
to understand when he speaks so plain?'</p>

<p>Drownlands folded his arms and walked
hurriedly up and down the room. Presently
he turned to Zita and said, 'You are serious
when you say you will not have me make you
my heir?'</p>

<p>'I am truly resolved,' answered the girl.
'Then he can no more say that I have sold
myself body and soul for profits.'</p>

<p>'Let no will be made.'</p>

<p>'That will not do. You must rewrite it, and
it must make Kainie your heir. Only on that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>

condition will I remain in this house with
you.'</p>

<p>'And you believe her to be your rival, who
has snatched Mark from your arms?'</p>

<p>'I know it is so. He could not help himself.
He was tied to her.'</p>

<p>'Mark is a Runham. A Runham may betray
a woman, but never marry one who has no
fortune.'</p>

<p>'More is the reason why you should give one
to Kainie.'</p>

<p>'Were I to make you my heir,—there is no
saying,—he might take you for the sake of this
place and my savings; and, by Heaven, I will
have no Runham own acres of mine, if I can
prevent it!'</p>

<p>'He would not do that—he could not take
me. He is too just and true to throw over
Kainie. He may think ill of me, but I do not
think so badly of him. I tried to buy of her
the rights she had in him, but she would not
sell them. Then I saw it was all up between
Mark and me.'</p>

<p>'This is strange—this is very strange!' said
Drownlands, turning a perplexed face on the
girl as he paced the room. 'I know what is in
a Runham better than you. The Runhams
marry for money, not for love. Come here,
Zita. What would you say were you to discover
that you were mistaken about Mark and
Kainie?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am not mistaken.'</p>

<p>'Suppose, some day, that you found that he
was free?'</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>'And yet he would never marry you without
money. He would not be a Runham to do
that. If, however, he thought you were to be
my heir, he might do so, or wait till I am gone
and then take you; but he will never think of
you if you are poor. Be it as you propose. I
will rewrite my will. I will leave to you nothing,
bequeath to Kainie all.'</p>

<p>'Then I will remain with you.'</p>

<p>'As long as I live?'</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>'You will swear to this?'</p>

<p>Her eyes were full, her bosom heaving; she
held out both hands, and he clasped them.</p>

<p>'I must go downstairs,' she said, after a
struggle to gain composure. 'The justices
will want their toasting-forks.'</p>

<p>'Keep them amused for a while. They shall
witness my new will.'</p>

<p>Zita proceeded to her room, found the articles
that she had promised, and descended to the
sitting-room, where she found three of the
magistrates, all laymen; the clerical members
of the Bench thinking it unecclesiastical to come
after toasting-forks. The red-faced chairman,
Mr. Christian, was there; Admiral Abbott; and
another, named Wilkins. They were all merry;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>

they had been drinking, and they felt sensible
relief that they were not cumbered by the
presence of the ecclesiastical magistrates. They
were also conscious of great buoyancy of spirits,
due to the fact that they were beyond the
shadow of the towers of Ely, and no longer
within the numbing circle of cathedral decorum.
Zita's arrival was hailed uproariously, with
laughter and loud words. The gentlemen
jumped from their chairs, and with effusion
insisted on shaking hands.</p>

<p>'We've rode over,' said Mr. Christian, 'but
couldn't persuade Sir Bates to mount a horse
again. The very looks of one makes his colour
fade. Nothing would induce him—not the
prospect of a toasting-fork. I say, Abbott, if
we could have promised the canon a kiss of
those ruby lips, eh? Would that have drawn
him? How now, you comical Jill?—you who
upset the dignity of the Court! And to venture
on bribery and corruption—you pretty little
rogue! We might have had you up. What
say you, Abbott? Shall we indict her for the
attempt to poison the springs of justice? It is
a case under common law. Fine or imprisonment?
Which shall it be, Wilkins?'</p>

<p>'Now, come,' said the magistrate addressed,
'no law here; we have had enough of that
today. Here are weapons. Arm thee, arm
thee, Sir Christian, knight of the blazing
countenance and the purple nose. Queen of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>

Cheap Jacks, let your gay red-flowered kerchief
be the prize. I defy thee to the death, Christian.
Up with you on to the table, Queen of Cheap
Jacks, or upon the mantelshelf—anywhere away
from the clash of blades and the soil of battle.
Come on, Christian! And after thee, Old Salt
the Admiral; but, Lord! he will swash about
with his toasting-fork as if 'twere a cutlass.
Come on, Christian, and he who wins rides
home wearing her favour.'</p>

<p>Justice Wilkins brandished one of the toasting-forks,
and, putting himself in a posture of attack,
shouted again for his opponent.</p>

<p>Mr. Christian at once snatched and flourished
his weapon, and the two half-tipsy men began
to make passes at each other.</p>

<p>'Bright eyes looking on! A fair maid's
favour as the prize! Ah, Christian, you're off
your guard; you are using your foil wildly.
The man is drunk! Heigh! To the heart! I
have run you through! Down with your blade,
sir!' Wilkins shouted as he charged home, and
drove the toasting-fork up into the handle
against the breast of his adversary. 'Abbott!
gallop off for Sir Bates! Make him come to
shrive Christian. Rest his soul! he was a jolly
dog, but too fond of lasses and the bottle.
Admiral, help me; we will compose his epitaph.
No, no, Christian, that is a breach of rules.
You're dead, man; dead as a stone, with a
stroke through your heart. Didn't you feel the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>

toasting-fork tickle your ribs? Stand aside, or
lie dead on the hearthrug. You are out of the
game now. Come on, Admiral Abbott. It lies
between you and me; Christian, you dog, you
are dead, and must not interfere. That stroke
will let some of the port wine out of your
gizzard. Keep in the rear—you are a dead
man. If you walk, it is your ghost. It is
Abbott's turn with me now.'</p>

<p>'Wilkins, your tongue runs away with you.
I'll cut it off and wear it in my hat. I'm your
man.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Admiral Abbott, armed with his
toasting-fork, strutted into the place lately
occupied by Christian.</p>

<p>'No,' said he; 'Wilkins, you cheat; you took
a scurvy advantage over my dear deceased
brother Christian. You shall not play me the
same trick. You have the window behind
you.'</p>

<p>'I did not consider it. Change sides.'</p>

<p>'No, I will not have the advantage over you
either. We will fight with the daylight athwart
our blades.'</p>

<p>'Then the Queen of Cheap Jacks must shift
quarters, to see that all is fair.'</p>

<p>'Let her shift,' said Abbott. 'I am not
going to be killed or to kill you at a disadvantage.
Ready!'</p>

<p>The passage of arms between Wilkins and
Abbott was as brief as that between him and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>

Christian. A stroke from the admiral, who
used his tool as a cutlass, bent the soft metal
of the toasting-fork of his opponent.</p>

<p>'Weapon broken. Surrender!' shouted
Abbott. 'Now, Wilkins, stand aside. I am
conqueror, and claim the red rag.'</p>

<p>'That's a way to ask! Like the bear you
are, Abbott. Down on one knee—I won't say
gracefully, for you can't do that—and ask in
courteous tone. Red rag indeed!—a crimson
favour.'</p>

<p>'He can't kneel,' said Christian. 'He'd never
get up if he were once down.'</p>

<p>'Admiral! I could swear the Cheap Jack
Queen has been crying. There are tears on
her cheek and a drench of rain in her
brown eyes. It is for you, Christian, you
lucky dog; you caused them to fall, because
I ran you through, and Her Royal Highness
weeps for her knight bleeding his life-tide
away.'</p>

<p>At this moment Drownlands entered the
room, and was saluted by the three magistrates.</p>

<p>'We have been fighting,' said the admiral,
'and I am the conqueror. If you are disposed
to part with the pretty housekeeper, I will carry
her off <i>en croupe</i> on my horse.'</p>

<p>Drownlands disdained an answer.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' said he, 'now that you are here,
let me ask a favour of you. Pray put your

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>

hands to this paper and witness my signature
to this my last will and testament.'</p>

<p>'I hope you have put the Queen of Cheap
Jacks down for something handsome. If you
have done that, we will sign cheerfully.'</p>

<p>'Not for a penny,' answered Drownlands.
'Everything I have goes to my niece. Here
is ink and here a pen. Gentlemen, this is my
true act and deed.'</p>

<p>'My hand shakes,' said Christian; 'I have
been laughing, and cannot hold a pen.'</p>

<p>'And mine is jarred,' said Wilkins, 'with
the thundering blows of that swashbuckler,
Abbott.'</p>

<p>Jesting, laughing, the three men complied
with the request of Drownlands, hardly regarding
what they were about.</p>

<p>'I say, Abbott,' said Wilkins, 'what was that
promise that fell from ruby lips relative to an
epergne?'</p>

<p>'We were to raffle for one,' said the admiral.</p>

<p>'Can't do it,' said Christian. 'We have not
got the others here. We'll hoist Bates on to a
horse and make him come another day, when
this confounded business of the riots is over.'</p>

<p>'You have got the favour, Abbott,' said
Wilkins, 'but not by fair swordsmanship.
Whether you carry it to Ely is another matter.
Christian, shall he hoist it at the end of his
toasting-fork and ride? We'll give him a
hundred yards, and then pursue, and he who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>

overtakes, captures the favour and carries it
into the city.'</p>

<p>'Done—we'll race the admiral for it.' Then,
turning to Zita, 'We'll come another day and
raffle for the epergne at a guinea a-piece. The
pool goes to you. Now then, brother justices,
away we go!'</p>

<p class="center">THE JACK O' LANTERNS</p>

<p class="p1">'TAKE it, and keep it,' said Drownlands,
handing the will to Zita. 'You can read.
It is as you desired, and on the same condition
as before. That is as you promised.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the girl; 'with that I am content.'
She put the will in her bosom.</p>

<p>'Then,' said Drownlands in a tone of sad
bitterness, 'for life and till death we are united.'</p>

<p>'After a fashion, to keep apart.'</p>

<p>'Yes, united to be separate.'</p>

<p>'Like a pair of wheels,' said Zita. 'They
keep the concern going, but have it always
between them.'</p>

<p>The day had closed in, and Zita retired to her
room to sit at the window and look out at the
dead uniformity of the fen, and the white line of
horizon between it and the darkness above, like
a white fringe to a pall. She desired solitude,
that she might review what was past.</p>

<p>The weather was cold. There had been

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>

frost, hard and biting, and the ice clad the
water. The snow that had been spread over
the land had in part disappeared, licked up by
the dry wind that scaled the waters, and the
land from whiteness had turned to blackness.</p>

<p>The lakes of frozen water would have attracted
many skaters during the day, had not the engrossing
excitement relative to the trial of the
rioters engaged the public attention.</p>

<p>The frost had set in with redoubled hardness
on the morrow of the riot, and in four days even
the Lark was turned to stone within its embankments.</p>

<p>As Zita looked out into the night, she could
see the heavy sky, burdened with black clouds,
that were ragged as a torn fringe, or a moth-eaten
pall, about the black hard bank of the
river, that stood up sharply against the sky.</p>

<p>The cold was so biting in the fireless room
that Zita drew the velvet curtains about her,
which were suspended over her window, covered
her shoulders, and wrapped them about her
bosom. There was no light in the room save
the wan reflection from the horizon. Had there
been, she would have formed a pretty picture,
folded in crimson velvet, with her oval face and
dark amber hair peeping out of the folds.</p>

<p>She looked dreamily through the window.</p>

<p>A wave of regret had come over her after the
exaltation caused by the sense of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>She considered how that she had loved Mark,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>

had valued his regard for herself, had delighted
in his society. He had never said to her that
he loved her, yet there had been a look in his
blue eyes, a pressure of his fingers when he
took her hand, a softness of intonation in his
voice when he spoke to her, that had said more
than words, that had assured her heart that she
was dear to him. And how happy she had been
when she believed that! A solitary child, with
no belongings and belonging to none, a waif
thrown upon the desolate fens, she had found
herself lifted into a new region of brightness.
Then Mark had become cool, and had held
aloof from her. She had discovered that he was
engaged to Kainie, and could not become disentangled
from this tie. He had been constrained
to resign himself to it. Now his interest, his
sympathies, were enlisted on behalf of that girl,
because she was treated with injustice and was
exposed to danger. Now he was about to take
Kainie to his house—now, this very evening.</p>

<p>A feeling of resentment against the girl who
stood between herself and happiness swelled in
Zita's heart; Kainie threw down the palace of
delight she had built up in the cloudland of
hope and fancy. Kainie snatched Mark from
her; and it was for Kainie that she—Zita—had
given up the inheritance offered her by Drownlands.</p>

<p>In the darkness Zita's brow darkened. Angry
feelings surged in her bosom and sent waves of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>

fire through her pulses. She would defy the
world. What need she care for the chatter of
slanderous tongues? Conscious of her own integrity,
she would brave public opinion.</p>

<p>She snatched the will from her bosom, that
she might tear it in pieces, and then she would
run to the master and bid him make another in
her own favour, as first proposed. Why should
she not be his heir?</p>

<p>If Kainie robbed her of Mark, might not she
retaliate and take from her the inheritance of
Drownlands?</p>

<p>If she were struck, might she not strike back?
Did Kainie need lands and houses? As Mark's
wife, she would be rich without her uncle's estate
added to Crumbland, whereas she—Zita—had
not a particle of soil on which to set her foot
and say it was her own. Had not the master of
Prickwillow a right to do what he would with
his own? Kainie had done nothing for him,
and she—Zita—was devoting her life to his
service.</p>

<p>As she looked out of the window, musing on
these things, she saw that the light on the
horizon had faded, or that the great curtain of
cloud had set over it and had obscured it.
Something, where she believed that the embankment
ran, now attracted, without greatly
engaging, her attention.</p>

<p>A minute flash of light travelled a little distance,
and was then extinguished. Presently

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>

another wavering speck appeared, and then
again all was dark.</p>

<p>'The Jack o'Lanterns are about,' said Zita.</p>

<p>Her thoughts recurred to her troubles.</p>

<p>A recoil of better feeling set in and washed
over her heart.</p>

<p>'No,' said she, 'I could not have borne it.
It would have killed me to have Mark believe
that I was sold body and soul. Let him take
Kainie, and with Kainie let him have Prickwillow
when it falls;—but let him not think ill
of me.'</p>

<p>She started up. She replaced the will in her
bosom.</p>

<p>'I will go to Red Wings,' she said. 'He is
there with Kainie. He said he would take her
away this night. I will go and tell him all. I
will show him what I have here;' she touched
her bosom where lay the will. 'When he has
heard my story and has seen that, he will think
better of me.'</p>

<p>She descended the staircase. At the foot she
found the master.</p>

<p>'There are Jack o'Lanterns in the fens,' she
said.</p>

<p>'Folks say that they have seen them,' he
replied. 'I never have. They were plentiful
before so much marsh was reclaimed.'</p>

<p>'I have seen them,' said Zita.</p>

<p>'Pshaw!' laughed he. 'There are no Jack of
Lanterns in winter. Whither are you going?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>'On the embankment; perhaps on the ice.
I wish to be alone.'</p>

<p>She drew a shawl over her head and opened
the door. Drownlands followed her to the
doorstep.</p>

<p>At that moment he also for a moment saw a
twinkle on the embankment.</p>

<p>'That is what you call Jack o' Lanterns,' said
he. 'It is some ganger going home. Shall I
attend you?'</p>

<p>'I desire to be alone.'</p>

<p>Then Drownlands went within, and Zita
walked on till she reached the highway that ran
below the embankment. It was so dark there
that she mounted the steep slope, so as to have
the advantage of what little light still hung in
the sky and was reflected by the frozen surface
of the river.</p>

<p>As she ascended, an uneasy sensation came
over her—a feeling that she was in the presence
of human beings whom she neither saw nor
heard. She stood still, listening. Then, stepping
forward, she was again conscious that she
was close upon some invisible person. Feeling
alarmed, Zita was about to retrace her steps,
when a light was flashed in her eyes and a hand
grasped her shoulder. Thereupon a voice said
in a low tone, 'It is that wench of Drownlands'.'
Then she was aware that several men surrounded
her. They had been crouching on the
ground for concealment, at the sound of her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>

approaching foot. Now they rose and pressed
about her. She could distinguish that these
were all men, and that they had black kerchiefs
over their faces with holes cut in them, through
which their eyes peered. One alone was not so
disguised, and he it was who spoke to her.</p>

<p>'Unhappy girl! You do not return. Go
your ways along the bank, and no harm will be
done to you. We have no quarrel with you, but
we have with your master. This night we strike
off a score, pay a debt.'</p>

<p>The voice was that of Ephraim Beamish.</p>

<p>'Throw her in. Send her under the ice. She's
a bad lot,' said one of the men.</p>

<p>'Make an end of all that belongs to Tiger Ki,'
said another.</p>

<p>'We do not fight with women,' said Beamish.
'She shall go, but not return to Prickwillow.'</p>

<p>'What are you about? What harm are you
doing?' asked Zita.</p>

<p>'We are serving out chastisement to your
master for what he has done to our lads,'
answered Pip.</p>

<p>'You will not hurt him?'</p>

<p>'Not in person.'</p>

<p>'What, then, will you do?'</p>

<p>'Go your way. We are letting the water out
over his land.'</p>

<p>Ephraim conducted Zita a little way along
the tow-path on the bank.</p>

<p>'Attend to me,' said he. 'Go anywhere you

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>

will except back to Prickwillow. We have our
men drawn across the way. You cannot pass,
it is in vain for you to attempt it. Keep to the
bank, and keep at a distance from us.'</p>

<p>'Where is Mark Runham?'</p>

<p>'I have not seen him.'</p>

<p>'He is not in this affair with you?'</p>

<p>'Mark? of course he is not. He knows
nothing of our purpose.'</p>

<p>Zita advanced along the path. She was
uneasy; desirous, if possible, to warn Drownlands.</p>

<p>Presently she heard a rush of water.</p>

<p>She turned, and was caught almost immediately
by one of the men.</p>

<p>'It is of no use your attempting to go home,'
he said. 'It is of no use your thinking of telling
Tiger Ki to be on his guard. It is now too
late.' The man took her wrist and said, 'Go
your way, but take care not to step on the ice—not
as you value your life.'</p>

<p>'The ice?—why so?'</p>

<p>'Listen.'</p>

<p>A shrill whine—then a crash. The icy surface
of the Lark had split, then gone down in fragments
under its own weight, as the water that
had sustained it was withdrawn.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A RETURN BLOW</p>

<p class="p1">ZITA hurried along the tow-path. Her mind
was in a tumult. The full force of the
words of Ephraim she could not understand.
He and his comrades were letting the waters of
the river Lark over Drownlands' farm, that she
knew; but to what an extent they would overflow,
and what amount of injury they might do,
that was what she was incapable of judging.
It was a relief to her mind that no personal
violence was contemplated. The water that
was let out could be pumped back again.
The Fens were wont to be flooded at times,
and the mills could always throw the flood from
off them.</p>

<p>It was natural that her thoughts should revert
to certain words that had been dropped by the
men—words that had fallen on her ears like
drops of fire. Why had Pip Beamish spoken to
her as an 'unhappy girl'? Why had she been
referred to as 'belonging to Drownlands,' as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>

'Tiger Ki's wench'? The tone in which these
words had been used had conveyed more insult
than the words themselves. They implied that
she was sold, as Mark had said, body and soul,
to the master of Prickwillow. Mark was not
alone in his ill opinion of her.</p>

<p>How had this opinion come to be formed?
Surely not from the fact that she was staying
on in the house where she had been sheltered
when her father died? Every one must know
that it was impossible for her to leave it, unless
she deserted her van and her wares.</p>

<p>There had been nothing in Drownlands' conduct
towards her in public to breed this opinion.
The spring of the scandal must have been in
Leehanna Tunkiss. That woman had viewed
the presence of Zita at Prickwillow with jealousy,
and had come to hate her.</p>

<p>In the first gush of womanly sympathy with
a forlorn child, left solitary, bereaved of her only
parent, the housekeeper had urged Zita to accept
the hospitality offered her, and had welcomed
her when she transferred herself from the van in
the outhouse into a room in the farm dwelling.
But no sooner did the keen eye of Leehanna
observe that Drownlands watched Zita with
interest, and that the girl was acquiring an
extraordinary influence over him, than her envy
was roused, and she was filled with alarm lest
her own position should be undermined, and she
should have to make way for the girl whom she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>

had so readily taken under the shelter of Prickwillow
roof.</p>

<p>Zita had not failed to notice the growing
malevolence exhibited towards her by this
woman. She had endeavoured to keep out of
her way, but had not laid much store on her
ill-humour. Now she saw, or suspected, that
Leehanna had been poisoning the minds of the
neighbourhood against her, and she had little
doubt that the alienation of Mark was due in a
measure to the slanders of Mrs. Tunkiss.</p>

<p>Presently Zita saw the light that shone from
Kainie's window. The girl had not as yet
deserted her habitation. A little muslin blind
was drawn across the casement, and the candlelight
shone hazily through that. During the
frost, when the waters were chained down, the
windmills were not worked, so that there was
no immediate necessity for a successor to take
the place of the girl-miller. No doubt that
Mark would inform the Commissioners that
Kainie's charge of the mill was at an end, and
that it was incumbent on them to immediately
look out for a successor. But Kainie had not
as yet departed, though it might be she was
preparing for her 'flitting.'</p>

<p>Had Mark come for her? Was he with her
now? Or was she sitting in her cottage with
throbbing heart, waiting for him to arrive?</p>

<p>Was it a fact that Mark Runham grasped at
money? It was not true. Drownlands had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>

charged him falsely in that. He was taking
Kainie, who had nothing. With a twinge, Zita
thought how that she herself was enriching her
rival with what might, had she willed it, become
her own. With a sickness at heart, Zita looked
forward to the day when Kainie would join the
acres of Prickwillow to those of Crumbland, and
bid Zita go forth a wanderer and destitute—and
it was her own doing.</p>

<p>Was she one who sold body and soul for
profits? She might have been Drownlands'
wife; she had refused this. She might have
been his heir; she had refused that: and Kainie
reaped all the advantages that sprang out of
her refusals.</p>

<p>No! There was something that was dearer
to Zita even than profits.</p>

<p>As Zita approached Red Wings, the dog,
standing on the brick platform, began to bark.
Zita called to him, and he came to her bounding.
On her former visits she had brought Wolf
something in her pocket. Now that he reached
her, he thrust his nose into her hand beseechingly.</p>

<p>She halted at the tuft of thorn-bushes and
flags below the platform, and seated herself
there, throwing her arm round the dog. She
would not present herself at the door of the hut,
and receive a rough greeting from Kainie. She
would wait and see whether Mark were there
before she made her presence known. The
explanation she had to make, the story to tell,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>

she would in preference make and tell to Mark.
She did not forget that she had struck Kainie,
and she knew that her chances of placing her
conduct in a favourable light were greater with
a man than with a woman.</p>

<p>A dark figure of a man issued from the
cottage door and stood on the platform, looking
round. After a moment he went back to the
door, saying—</p>

<p>'There is no one that I can see, but the night
is dark, Kainie.'</p>

<p>The voice was that of Mark.</p>

<p>He did not re-enter the cottage, but, standing
where he was, he said—</p>

<p>'Come, Kainie, it is time for us to be off. My
mother is expecting you.'</p>

<p>The girl issued from the hovel.</p>

<p>'Mark,' said she, 'has she really consented to
receive me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, she has.'</p>

<p>'Yet I know that she has refused to see me,
and even to hear about me.'</p>

<p>'That is true, but now she has given way. I
could not allow you to remain here. I took a
firm stand with my mother, and she admitted
that I was right, and yielded. Now, have you
got all ready for the sledge?'</p>

<p>'I have packed everything.'</p>

<p>'Then jump on to the sleigh, and I will run
you along upon the ice, which is in prime
condition.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Zita's arm convulsively nipped the dog.</p>

<p>How happy she had been on that day when
Mark had run her along on the ice on the same
bones that were now to bear her successful rival!</p>

<p>Wolf protested against the pressure of her
arm by a growl.</p>

<p>'Where are you, Wolf?' called Mark.</p>

<p>Zita released the dog, and he sprang upon the
platform.</p>

<p>'I wonder what the old fellow means,' said the
young man. 'He does not usually give false
alarms. I daresay he's puzzled at our proceedings.
Something affecting his interests is in
view, Kainie, and he can't understand it. It
is so dark one can't see far; but had any one
been coming, he would have given tongue
lustily.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it may be Pip.'</p>

<p>'Pip will have to be careful for the next day
or two. If he be caught, 'twill go hard with
him for certain.'</p>

<p>'But you will get him away from the Fens?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I am making arrangements. If he
can keep hidden for a few more days and
nights, I shall have managed matters, and be
able to clear him off; to clear him not only
from the Fens, but out of England. Now, however,
we must think of you. Take with you
only such traps as you need immediately, and
which you can carry in your arms or on your
lap. I'll return for the rest to-morrow.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>'I shall leave the fire burning and the light
on the table.'</p>

<p>'Yes, for Pip when he comes. Folk will think
nothing of seeing the light, making sure it is
yours. He can hide here till I am ready to send
him away; and Wolf shall remain to give him
notice if any one approaches. I'll tie him up.'</p>

<p>Kainie re-entered the cottage, and Mark proceeded
to tie Wolf by a piece of twine that he
had in his pocket.</p>

<p>Whilst he was thus engaged, Kainie came out
with her little package, and stood watching the
proceedings of the young man.</p>

<p>The dog was restless, and objected to being
fastened.</p>

<p>'Don't be angry with me, Mark,' said Kainie,
'if I ask you a question.'</p>

<p>'No; what may it be?'</p>

<p>'It concerns that wretched creature—that
Cheap Jack girl. You were rather taken with
her at first, Mark, till you found out what she
was. You are quite sure you don't fancy her no
longer?'</p>

<p>The young fellow had been stooping over the
dog. He stood up and said gravely—</p>

<p>'Kainie! I regard her now no more than I do
the dirt under my soles.'</p>

<p>'Hark! what is that?'</p>

<p>The sound was that of a gasp or sob.</p>

<p>'There is certainly some one here,' said Mark.
'Bring a light.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>'You need not,' said Zita, rising from behind
the thorns. 'It is I.'</p>

<p>'You here, Zita?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I heard what you said of me.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry for that.'</p>

<p>'It is cruelly false.'</p>

<p>'I cannot go into that matter. What has
brought you here at this time o' night?'</p>

<p>'What has brought her here?' repeated
Kainie. 'There is no need to ask that, Mark;
the wretched creature is running after you.'</p>

<p>'You must go back,' said the young man.</p>

<p>'Yes, go back—to your dear master,' sneered
Kainie.</p>

<p>'I must speak. I must justify myself,' said
Zita, with vehemence. 'You wrong me in your
thoughts; you wrong me in your words. I am
not what you suppose. I am not a bold, bad
girl. I do not sell myself for profits. I am in
Drownlands' house because I cannot help myself.
I have nowhere else whither to go. Why
should you and Kainie believe evil of me?
Why should'—</p>

<p>'I cannot argue with you,' said Mark. 'This
is not the place; this is not the time. I am
sorry for you. I can say no more. I thought
better of you once.'</p>

<p>'Go, you Cheap Jackess,' said Kainie. 'Unless
you had a heart lost to shame, you'd not
have come here after Mark at night.'</p>

<p>'You misjudge me in this as in other things,'

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>

said Zita, bursting into tears. 'I came here for
your good.'</p>

<p>'That's a fine tale,' sneered Kainie. 'We
want no good from you, nor do we expect figs
of thistles or grapes of thorns.'</p>

<p>Mark said nothing, but stepped from the
platform.</p>

<p>'I entreat you to listen to me,' said Zita,
catching his arm. 'It is not true that Drownlands
has left me everything.'</p>

<p>'I cannot attend to this now,' said he, disengaging
himself from her grasp. But she again
seized him.</p>

<p>'Unsay what you said!' she exclaimed. Her
anger was rising and overmastering her grief.
'Unsay those ugly words—that I am the dirt
under your feet.'</p>

<p>'I said—but never mind. I regret that you
overheard me use such an expression.'</p>

<p>'That is not unsaying it.'</p>

<p>Kainie came up and struck Zita with the full
force of her heavy hand across the face.</p>

<p>'Take that,' she said; 'I have owed it you.
Now the debt is repaid.'</p>

<p>Then she stepped on the ice with a 'Mark, I
am ready.'</p>

<p>'Go!' cried Zita in towering wrath, stung
with pain, maddened with humiliation. 'Go—go
under the ice, both of you! I care not! I
care not!'</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A CATHERINE WHEEL</p>

<p class="p1">THE words were hardly out of Zita's mouth
before they were repented. The anger,
the desire for revenge, which had spurted up in
her heart, was abated as rapidly as it had risen.</p>

<p>Once before she had spoken in violence of
anger, and had speedily contradicted her words
by her acts. She had bidden Mark go and be
hanged or transported for aught she cared;
yet no sooner did she learn that he was in actual
danger, than she had interfered to deliver him.
She had fought for him with Drownlands, and
had thrust herself into the witness-box to
exculpate him.</p>

<p>Stinging now under the moral pain of the
sense of wrong done to her, that wounded her in
her honour, stinging also under the physical pain
caused by the blow of Kainie, a girl for whom
she had made the greatest sacrifices, in a blind
and inconsiderate explosion of resentment, she
had allowed Mark and Kainie, unwarned of their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>

danger, to commit themselves to the treacherous
ice.</p>

<p>Repentance came too late. The words had
been spoken which hinted danger, but the hint
was too vague to be regarded, even to be understood.
Mark had started, running Kainie on
his sledge over the polished surface of the
channel, before Zita had recovered herself and
realised what would be the consequences of her
neglect.</p>

<p>Then, with a cry, the girl ran along the bank.
She called to Mark, imploring him to return.
She called, telling him that the ice was broken.
Then she stayed, out of breath, her pulses
bounding, the sweat streaming off her brow, and
the tears racing down her cheeks.</p>

<p>She found that it was not possible for her to
catch up the sledge, that flew like a swallow
over the glassy ice, and which was invisible in
the darkness. She found that the wind was
blowing in her face, and carrying her voice
behind her, away from those whose attention she
desired to arrest.</p>

<p>In her despair, she threw herself on her knees
and beat her head and breast.</p>

<p>'I am worse than what they thought of me!
I am worse than that murderer Drownlands.
He killed one, and I kill two. Oh that I had
died in their place!'</p>

<p>Again she sprang to her feet, and again she
cried to those who were speeding far away, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>

bade them return. She was sensible, as she
called, that she could do nothing to arrest them
in their course. The horror of the situation was
insupportable, and in a wave of despair that
swept over her, Zita was ready to fling herself
into the canal.</p>

<p>There are moments of life when instantaneously
a whole prospect opens before the inner
eye—call that eye what you will. In a second
of time Zita saw the consequences of her neglect
mirrored before her with intense and terrible
vividness. It was as though the whole sequence
of events that must follow was unrolled before
her eye, and, clear as in broadest day, she saw
the sledge, propelled by Mark, approach the
dangerous spot where the arch of ice stood
unsupported, and when the additional weight was
thrown on it, must come crashing down. She
heard the whine of the cracking surface, as the
sleigh reached it. She saw the whole mass of
ice, together with sleigh, Mark, and Kainie, go
down with a crash, impelled by the velocity of
the pace at which they had been going—saw
them shoot under the water, and the sheets of
fractured ice that encumbered the surface of the
shrunken river. She heard the cry of Mark, the
scream of Kainie. She saw them battling with
their hands beneath the surface. It was to her
as though she were looking from above on the
glassy sheet that lay broken, but yet encasing
the water. She could see through it, and watch

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>

the expiring efforts of Mark and Kainie, behold
them struggling with their hands to break
through or push aside the ice-plate that lay
between their mouths and air. She could see
their straining eyes fixed reproachfully on her
through the transparent screen. In her fancy
she was now running and beckoning to the only
patch of open water through which escape was
possible. And yet they would not attend;
either they misunderstood her signals, or they
mistrusted her motives.</p>

<p>She beheld how their efforts relaxed, their
palms patted listlessly against the ice, their
fingers picked with feeble effort at the cracks,
how the light of intelligence died out of their
eyes, how their lips gasped and drew in water.</p>

<p>Then to her fancy they went down, Kainie
first, Mark next.</p>

<p>After that there rose about her, as a cloud, a
mass of black figures, pointing at her with their
fingers, and from every finger-point flashed an
electric spark.</p>

<p>'Murderess—double murderess! Thou who
didst judge Drownlands, judge thine own self.
Thou who didst condemn, condemn thyself.'</p>

<p>Then Wolf came to her. He had gnawed
through the cord that had bound him.</p>

<p>Zita clasped him round the neck.</p>

<p>'Oh, Wolf! Wolf!' she cried. 'Go after them—fly—stay
them. Snap at Mark's clothes.
Bite Kainie. Hold them back!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>She indicated the direction that the sledge had
taken, and the dog ran out on the ice.</p>

<p>Zita looked after him. Would he be able to
track them on the frozen sheet? Would the
scent lie on the congealed water?</p>

<p>If Wolf did come up with his mistress and
Mark, would he be able to arrest their course?
Did he understand the message, the order given
him? Would he, bounding forward in advance
of the sledge, discover for himself the danger
that lay ahead, and come back and warn them?</p>

<p>Should this attempt to stay the sleigh fail,
were there no other means available?</p>

<p>Then an idea flashed through the brain of
Zita. There remained one chance of staying
their career.</p>

<p>Instantly Zita ran to the hut, burst open the
door, and, seizing the mattress of Kainie's bed,
dragged it forth across the platform, and threw
it under the stationary sails of the mill.</p>

<p>Then she went back to the cottage, and,
gathering up the red embers of the fire in a
shovel, ran with them forth again, and threw
them upon the straw mattress.</p>

<p>Next she stood, shovel in hand, waiting the
result, watching as the fire burnt its way through
the ticking and buried itself in the straw.</p>

<p>For a moment there ensued a red glare—an
eating outward of the ticking by fiery teeth—then
a ghost-like flame leaped up, and wavered
above the incandescent mass. It threw itself

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>

high into the air, as though it were independent
of the fire below, then returned and dipped its
feet in the red ashes. With the shovel Zita
stirred the ignited mass. Then the mattress
broke into flame, and the flame reared itself in
many tongues, swayed with the wind, curled
over, broke into a multitude of orange fire-flashes
that capered and pirouetted about the glowing
heart of fire, as though the fabled Salamanders
had manifested themselves, and rejoiced in
being able to dance in their proper element. In
another moment the flames had ignited the sail
that hung above them, and were racing each
other up the canvas.</p>

<p>Zita sped to the clog. She had learned from
Kainie how a windmill was to be set in motion,
and how the revolution of the sails was to be
arrested, on the first visit she had paid to Red
Wings. She now raised the clog, and with a
sigh and creak the arms began to turn. As
they did so, the sail which was on fire swept
from the bed of flames that had kindled it, and
was replaced by another. Instantly Zita stopped
the revolution, to allow it also to be kindled. In
like manner she treated the remaining sails, and
when all blazed, she allowed them to spin unhampered
in the breeze.</p>

<p>A wondrous sight in the black night! The
mill sails whirling in the freezing blast sent
forth streamers of flame and a rain of sparks.
Every now and then there dropped from them

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>

incandescent tears. They roared as they went
round, forming, as they rotated on the axle, a
mighty wheel of dazzling light. Zita stood
looking up at her work, and for a moment forgot
the occasion of the setting fire to the wheel
in the overwhelming effect produced by the
brilliancy of the spectacle. The wind not only
made the canvas glare, but kindled as well the
stretchers of lath to which it was fastened, and
the mainbeams likewise. The ties by which the
sail-cloth was fastened were of tarred cord. As
the fire consumed a portion, the rest slipped
forth, and flew away in lurid lines of light.</p>

<p>The platform was illumined, as though a blaze
of July sun had fallen on it. The window-panes
of the cottage were transmuted into flakes of
gold-leaf. The dykes reflected the flashing sails,
and shot the light along in streaks through the
dark fen into the outer darkness beyond.</p>

<p>A number of bats that had been harboured by
the old mill, and were sleeping through the
winter, were roused by the light, quickened by
the heat, and came forth in flights, dazed, to
flit on leather wings about the platform, to dart
into the wheel of fire, and to fly back scorched,
and to fall crippled at Zita's feet.</p>

<p>Wolf came up cowering. He had been unable
to trace the course of his mistress on the ice,
and he crouched moaning at Zita's feet, his eyes
watching the fiery revolutions, but ever and
anon starting back with a snap and a whine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>

as some disabled bat clawed at him, and
endeavoured to scramble up his side.</p>

<p>Would the whole mill fall a prey to the
flames?</p>

<p>Ignited, molten tar was flung off as fire dross
by the whirling sails, masses of burning canvas
were carried off on the wind. The sails for
a while moved more slowly. The canvas was in
part consumed, but the flame itself seemed to
form a sheet over the ribs, and incite the wind
to act with redoubled force; for again, with
renewed activity, the great arms continued their
rotation.</p>

<p>Every rush in the dyke was made visible,
standing out as a rod of burnished gold, and the
withered tassels of seed glowed scarlet, against
a background of night made doubly sombre by
the dazzling splendour of the burning mill sails.</p>

<p>The boarded and tarred body of the mill was
changed in the lurid glare into a structure of
red copper. In the heat given off by the wings,
the tar dissolved and ran down from the
movable cap, as though the great bulk of the
mill were sweating in an agony of fear lest the
fire should reach and consume it also.</p>

<p>A barn-owl hovered aloft, and the glare
smote on its white breast and under-wings. It
to-whooed in its terror, and its cry could be
heard above the rush of the sails and the roar
of the flames.</p>

<p>There were other sounds that combined with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>

the hooting of the owl, the rush of the sails and
of the fire. The mechanism of the mill was in
motion; the huge axle revolved and throbbed
like a great pulse running through the body of
the structure, the wheels creaked and groaned,
the paddles laboured to drive the water up the
incline, and the water when it came produced
strange sounds beneath the ice, gasps and gulps.
It was as though the dykes were sobbing at the
combustion and destruction of the engine which
had so long and so steadily laboured to drain
them.</p>

<p>When the fire reached iron and copper nails
and bands, and heated the metals to white heat,
they became incandescent, and gave forth
streams of green and blue flame, that glowed
with the marigold yellow and tiger-lily red of
the blazing wood and tar, forming of the fiery
circle a rainbow complete in its prismatic tints.
The clouds that passed overhead were flushed
and palpitated, reflecting the fire below.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the anguish of mind that
possessed Zita, her anxiety for the fate of Mark
and Kainie, and her self-reproach, she was
carried away, out of all such thoughts, by the
transcendent splendour of the spectacle. She
stood looking up at the wheel of light, with
hands clasped to her bosom, hardly breathing,
her face illumined as though she had been
looking into the sun.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a hand was laid roughly on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>

her shoulder, and an agitated voice said in her
ear, 'Good heavens! what have you done?—wicked,
malignant girl!'</p>

<p>Zita dropped on her knees, with a cry of
mingled joy and pain.</p>

<p>'Thank God! they are saved!'</p>

<p>She stooped and hid her face in her skirt
about her knees. The revulsion of feeling was
more than she could bear. She gasped for
breath. She came to a full stop in sensation
and thought. She could not rise, speak, nor
look up. Then relief from acute tension of the
mind found itself a way in a flood of tears, and
broken words of no meaning and without connection
were sobbed forth, and muffled in her
gown.</p>

<p>When, finally, she did raise her head, and
gather her dazed faculties, and wipe the water
from her eyes, she saw that Mark and Kainie
were forcing the head of the mill round, so as
no longer to present the sails to the wind, but
make them face away from it, so as to lessen
the danger to the body of the mill, which might
at any moment ignite when flame and sparks
were swept over it.</p>

<p>They then put on the clog and stopped the
movement of the charred arms.</p>

<p>This was almost all that could be done.
They trusted that the arms would burn themselves
out without the axle catching fire.</p>

<p>'Kainie,' said Mark, 'I'll run a rope up and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>

throw it over the axle, and you can pass me up
buckets of water.'</p>

<p>Then he came to where Zita knelt. Kainie
was at his side.</p>

<p>'You infamous creature!' said Kainie. 'Why
did you do it?'</p>

<p>'To save you and Mark.'</p>

<p>'To save us? That is a fine story.'</p>

<p>'They had let out the water, and the ice is
broken up.'</p>

<p>'Let out what water?' asked Mark.</p>

<p>'The water of the river.'</p>

<p>'Who have done this?'</p>

<p>'Why, Pip and some other men.'</p>

<p>'Zita,' said Mark, 'what do you mean? Is
there any truth in this?'</p>

<p>'It is true, indeed,' she answered. 'They
have done it to revenge themselves on Mr.
Drownlands, because he gave evidence against
some of their comrades.'</p>

<p>'This is very serious,' said Mark.</p>

<p>'It is quite true. They would not allow me
to go back to Prickwillow. I tried, but they
stopped me, and forced me to come on this way.
I could not warn the master. And they told
me to keep off the ice. As I came along, I
heard it scream and crack, and go down in a
mass together.'</p>

<p>'Why did you not tell me this before?'</p>

<p>'You would not listen to me. You said cruel
things of me, and Kainie struck me in the face.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>'And why did you set the mill on fire?'</p>

<p>'To force you to come back. I did not care
about your danger till too late. I ran after
you, you could not hear me. I knew that if
you saw fire at the mill you would return.
Nothing but that could bring you back.'</p>

<p>Mark was silent for a moment. Then, with
emotion in his voice, he said—</p>

<p>'Zita, I believe we have wronged you
grievously.'</p>

<p>'No,' answered the girl, 'it was I who wronged
you. I let you go, and said, Go under the ice
and be drowned, I did not care.'</p>

<p>'I did not hear you.'</p>

<p>'I said it—instead of telling you of your
danger. I was angry—very angry, and I was
hurt by Kainie—but'—she hesitated, her voice
faltered—'at the bottom of all was this—I was
jealous.'</p>

<p>'Jealous? Jealous of whom?'</p>

<p>'Mark, you had been so kind to me. I had
been so happy with you. I even thought you
liked me. Then you turned away from me for
Kainie.'</p>

<p>'For Kainie?'</p>

<p>There was surprise in his face.</p>

<p>'Yes, you like her best. You are right—she
is good, and I am bad—but it made me jealous.'</p>

<p>'Good heavens! You do not understand.
There is now no need for further concealment.
Kainie is my sister!'</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE BRENT-GEESE</p>

<p class="p1">IT was even as Mark said, but the particulars
relative to Kerenhappuch did not come to
the knowledge of Zita till some time later.</p>

<p>Jake Runham, the father of Mark, had made
the acquaintance of Drownlands' sister, and had
betrayed her. Instead of marrying her, he
suddenly took a woman who was an heiress,
married her for her money, and left Leah
Drownlands to her shame.</p>

<p>The secret of Leah's disgrace was well kept.
She was sent away to a distance, and when she
returned after five years with a child, she would
say nothing relative to the parentage of Kainie,
nor did her brother proclaim it. Ki never
forgave his sister, and would never hold communication
with her or receive her child. Jake
Runham naturally enough was reserved on the
matter, and no one suspected who the father of
Kainie was. The public believed that, to use
their own terms, Leah had 'met with a misfortune'
whilst away from the Fens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>On her return to the neighbourhood of Prickwillow,
the unfortunate woman obtained from
the Commissioners the use of the cottage and a
small allowance, on consideration of her attending
to the mill. This pittance she eked out
with needlework. Mark had entertained no
suspicion of the relationship so long as his
father lived, but on his death there was that
provision made in the will which revealed the
long-hidden secret. Jake acknowledged his
paternity to Kainie, and solemnly required his
son to provide for and watch over his half-sister.
It seemed probable that he had in the past
secretly contributed something towards the maintenance
of Leah Drownlands and her daughter.</p>

<p>These facts were not as yet generally known,
but now that Kainie was to be removed to
Crumbland, it was inevitable that they should
be made public.</p>

<p>The reason why Mark was so resolved to
take Kainie away from Red Wings was that
she was harbouring and screening Ephraim
Beamish, to whom she was attached and
engaged. Mark saw that this could not be
suffered to continue. He urged the case with
his mother, who had strenuously opposed the
reception of the girl into the farm, but who now,
as a good woman, yielded when she considered
the gravity of the circumstances.</p>

<p>Ever since the death of Jake Runham, Kerenhappuch
had known the truth. It had been

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>

necessary for Mark to tell her of their relationship,
and of the obligation that had been laid
upon him. At the same time, to save his father's
memory, he urged her to keep the matter secret.
This it was which made her reticent with Zita.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Come,' said Mark. 'Now is not the time for
an explanation—nor can I speak of such matters
to you without pain, for my father did a great
wrong. The question at this moment is—What
is to be done? Here is the mill running a risk
of being burnt down; on the other hand, there
is the water which has been let out, pouring
over the Fens. The latter is the most serious
concern. If the mill be consumed, it can be
rebuilt speedily; but if the fen be flooded, it
will take years before it recovers.'</p>

<p>He took Zita's hand in his.</p>

<p>'I do believe I have been unjust. So has
Kainie. We owe our lives to you. Kainie, ask
her to forgive you the blow you dealt her.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Zita. 'I struck Kainie first, and
she gave me the blow back again—harder than
I struck her, but that was her profits.'</p>

<p>It seemed probable that the fire smouldering in
the ribs of the sails would become extinct. There
were matters more urgent, calling Mark elsewhere.</p>

<p>'Pip knew better than advise me of his intent,'
said Mark. 'We must have a light.'</p>

<p>He tore one of the stakes from the sails of
the mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>'It will serve as a torch,' said he. 'Run, Kainie,
to the bridge, give the alarm to the bankers
there. Tell them to bring tools and all needful
down the embankment.'</p>

<p>'But they must not take Pip.'</p>

<p>'Pip will have sheered off long before they
reach the place. Run, Kainie. Come on, Zita,
and show me where the bank has been cut
through.'</p>

<p>They walked on together, and their shadows
were cast before them by the still glowing mill,
which now and then shot up into flame, and
then became a smouldering mass.</p>

<p>They walked fast, but not very fast; that was
hardly possible on the bank.</p>

<p>For a while Mark said nothing, but he put
out his hand, and took that of Zita.</p>

<p>'There has been great misunderstanding,' he
said meditatively.</p>

<p>'Yes,'she replied, 'indeed there has. I was
jealous because I thought you liked Kainie
best.'</p>

<p>'And I—I do not know what I thought; evil
things were said, and I was a fool, a cursed
fool, to believe them. So—you were jealous?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mark.'</p>

<p>'You could not have been jealous if you had
not cared for me.'</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>'And I believe the Reason why I gave ear to
evil words was because I loved you—loved you

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>

so dearly that I was jealous through every thread
of my being. I was jealous of that fellow
Drownlands. I was an ass to think those
things could be possible that were said of you.
I ought to have known you better.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mark, you ought to have known me
better.'</p>

<p>'But it is not now too late. Zita, we will be
to each other as we were before—that is, if you
can forgive me.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I can forgive you.'</p>

<p>'And I will let all know that we understand
each other. And, Zita,' he laughed, 'we'll have
the old van and Dobbin'—</p>

<p>'He is Jewel, not Dobbin.'</p>

<p>'And Jewel, brought over to Crumbland.'</p>

<p>'That cannot be, Mark, now.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'It is too late.'</p>

<p>'How too late?'</p>

<p>'I have promised Drownlands to remain with
him at Prickwillow, and take care of his house
as long as he lives.'</p>

<p>'That won't hold. If I make you my wife'—</p>

<p>'That cannot be.'</p>

<p>'Cannot be?—it shall be.'</p>

<p>'No, Mark, I gave you up. I gave up my
thoughts of you as a husband in order to get Ki
Drownlands to desist from appearing against
you in court.'</p>

<p>'He could have done nothing.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>'Whether he could or could not, matters
nought now. I made a promise.'</p>

<p>'You must break it.'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'A deal is a deal.'</p>

<p>Then, as both remained silent, suddenly
strange sounds were heard high up in the dark
sky, a sound as of barking dogs in full career.</p>

<p>Zita shivered and caught hold of Mark.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said in a whisper, full of fear.
'They scent a soul—they hunt a soul! Oh,
poor soul! God help it! Poor soul—run—run—swift—in
at heaven's door!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, little frightened creature! It is
the brent-geese!'</p>

<p>'Mark, last time I heard them it betokened
death. Then it was two souls—two flying—flying—and
the dogs in full career after them.'</p>

<p>'You, Zita,' laughed Mark, 'do you remember
when we spoke of this on the ice, I
said when next you heard the brent-geese I
hoped I might stand by you. Zita, please God,
when the hell-hounds, if such they be,—and I
don't believe a word of it,—be let loose, scenting
my soul or yours, that I may be by you, or you
by me, to cheer each other in the final and
dreadful race.'</p>

<p>Zita shuddered.</p>

<p>'Mark, it may not be. I shall stand by
Drownlands. I have promised—a deal is a
deal.'</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE CUT EMBANKMENT</p>

<p class="p1">DROWNLANDS had been for some time
in the upstairs room that served as his
office. He had brought out his account-books,
lighted his lamp, and was endeavouring to
engage his thoughts on his expenditure in wages,
and to go over the names of his workmen, and
strike out such as had taken part in the recent
riot. But it was in vain. After a few futile
attempts, he leaned his head on his palm, and
gave himself over to thoughts of Zita.</p>

<p>It was poor comfort to him to know that she
would remain in his house, but it was a comfort.
He felt confidence in her—that, having passed
her word to remain, remain she would, whatever
might happen. Whatever animadversions might
be made on her presence in his house, however
deeply her reputation might suffer, she would
stay with him. She had passed her word. It
was not unlikely, he thought, that some swain
might become enamoured of her, and ask her to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>

join her lot with his, but she would refuse him.
She would remain an old maid at Prickwillow,
because she had passed her word. Not for a
moment did Drownlands' faith in Zita give way.
She had impressed the man indelibly with a
conviction of her sincerity. Zita as a Cheap
Jack was one thing, Zita in private life was
another. She had one conscience for her dealings
with the general public, another conscience
for her dealings with individuals face to face.
The sun might rise in the west and go down in
the Orient sky, but Zita could not fail to keep
her word.</p>

<p>Drownlands was startled from his reverie by
the maid Sarah, who rushed in at the door,
exclaiming—</p>

<p>'Master, the water be out!'</p>

<p>'What water?'</p>

<p>'The boy says the fen is flooded.'</p>

<p>'Flooded?'</p>

<p>'He says the bank be broke.'</p>

<p>'The Lark embankment?'</p>

<p>Drownlands realised instantly the significance
of the announcement.</p>

<p>'Quick!' said he; 'light me the lantern.
Sharp! No time is to be lost.'</p>

<p>He ran to the corner to snatch up a stick, and,
without observing what he did, laid hold of the
flail. He did not perceive his mistake till he
had reached the foot of the staircase. Then he
could not delay to return and exchange it for a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>

staff. He caught the lantern from the hand of
Sarah and went out into the yard. His feet at
once splashed into water.</p>

<p>'What has happened?' he exclaimed, with an
oath. 'It cannot be that they have cut the
embankment.'</p>

<p>He splashed on. Over the frozen surface of
the soil a ripple of water was running, followed
by another ripple, and with each the film of
water covering the yard was sensibly deepened.</p>

<p>'The bank must have broken. The frost has
done it. They would never have dared to
cut it.'</p>

<p>Swaying his lantern, Drownlands strode
through the water, out of the stackyard and into
the drove that led from his farm to the highway.
This had been much cut up that day by his
waggons carting roots. The heavy vehicles
with broad wheels had crushed through the icy
crust, and the hoofs of the horses had assisted in
breaking up the frost case. Thus in places the
water was able to act on the unfrozen peat, and
undermine the surface that was hard frozen.
The peat was dry, and when the water reached
it, it swelled as a sponge.</p>

<p>A tide was flowing down the drove. On both
sides were the frozen dykes; the water covered
the ice, running along it, and but for the sedge
and rushes that rose out of the ditches, their
presence would have been undefined.</p>

<p>The brow of Drownlands darkened, and his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>

cheeks glowed. Was this the meaning of the
threats launched against him? He had never
conceived it possible that the men would have
recourse to such means as this to pay off their
grudge against him, for to inundate the farm
was to destroy their field of labour.</p>

<p>'I wish I had brought my gun,' said he.
'And then, should I see one of the scoundrels,
I'd shoot him with no more scruple than I would
a dotterel. As it is, let me come upon one,'—he
raised and flourished his flail,—'and I will beat
out his brains.'</p>

<p>Drownlands walked with difficulty. Where
the surface under the water was frozen, there it
was slippery. Where it was broken through
and broken up by the wain wheels and horse
hoofs, there it was slough.</p>

<p>Ruts, still frozen, were in places two or three
feet in depth, and they were filled. Invisible
under the water, he was liable to sink into them.
He stumbled along, angry, swearing, advancing
with labour, forced to hold his lantern, first to
one side, then to the other, to make sure that he
was not turning from his road, his sole guide
being the sedge lines, one on each side.</p>

<p>The roads in the Fens are not made of stone,
for stone is not to be found in the Fens. The
soil hardens with drought and frost. In rainy
weather it is a slough. The draining-machines,
being almost constantly at work, suck all the
moisture out of the soil, and as it dries it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>

shrinks. Now that the water from the canal
was overflowing the fen, it rippled on innocuously
over the icy case, but wherever it could penetrate
through that case, at every crack, at every dint,
it was drunk in in heavy draughts by the thirsty
soil, that immediately heaved and swelled as it
imbibed the moisture, and in so doing dissolved
into slough.</p>

<p>The tide continued to flow. In the yard the
water had been hardly as high as the instep.
It now flowed over the boot tops.</p>

<p>The water was intensely cold.</p>

<p>Drownlands had on his boots, such as he wore
ordinarily, but not his wading boots that reached
to the thighs. He had not thought it necessary
to wear such protectors in frosty weather. Those
he wore did not extend higher than his calves.
Already, in one of his plunges into a rut filled
with water, he had soaked his feet, his boots, so
far from serving as a protection, being an encumbrance.
The flail, moreover, was of small
service; the handfast was not of length sufficient
for him to probe the water before him and sound
his way. Would that he had drawn on his
wading-boots—would that he had brought a
leaping-pole!</p>

<p>Drownlands turned his head over his shoulder
and looked back at the house. He could see the
light from the kitchen and that from his office—the
latter partially, as, owing to the broken
glass in the window, he had closed the shutters.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>

He had left his lamp burning, and he could distinguish
its light in a line where the shutters
closed imperfectly.</p>

<p>It seemed to the man that the distance he
had come was greater than it really was.</p>

<p>The difficulty of advancing must increase with
every few minutes. In a quarter of an hour it
would not be possible to traverse the distance
between Prickwillow and the embankment save
by boat.</p>

<p>He must reach the tow-path, and hasten
along it to the nearest station, where a gang of
workmen was quartered, with implements and
material ready on an emergency.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost. Every minute
was of importance. Drownlands knew but too
well that if his farm were inundated, it would be
rendered valueless for several years. It would
not be utter ruin, as he had the savings of the
past to eat into, but it would prevent his reaping
advantage from his land till it had been completely
recovered of the effects of the flood.</p>

<p>Struggling with the rising tide, he succeeded
in getting upon the highway. But now his
difficulties were the greater, for he had entered
into the current that poured from the Lark.
The water rushed over his knees. The cold was
almost insupportable. With body bent, step by
step, helping himself onwards with the flail, but
unable always to trust it, owing to the pits in the
submerged surface, he advanced slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>He held up the lantern and looked round.
The tallow candle through the horn sides but
feebly illumined the night. It showed the
gurgling water in which he was wading, but it
showed nothing beside. He did not any longer
know his direction. He must stem the current,
but was unable to judge where the edge and
where the centre of the current were that poured
against him.</p>

<p>When he lowered his lantern, he was aware of
a lurid light in the sky above the embankment,
and saw now and then a brilliant spark thrown
up. That there was a fire somewhere he could
not doubt, and concluded that the rioters who
had cut the embankment were continuing their
incendiary work as before. He could not see
the wheel of fire; he was too low down for that,
but he saw the illumination caused by it. Suddenly
his feet gave way, and he fell in the water.
He had gone into one of the deepest cart-ruts.
As he fell, his lantern was extinguished.</p>

<p>It was now impossible for him to return. He
could not, if he wished it, have retraced his
steps. His only possible course was to scramble
up the bank, and to do this he now devoted all
his energies. But unhappily he had reached precisely
that point where the bank had been cut
through, and was therefore exposed to the full
force of the outrush of the river. As, by a
desperate effort, he recovered his feet, he could
see the lip of water curling over, reddened by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>

the reflection of the fire beyond. He was
drenched in the ice-cold water, but that was
nothing to the anguish in his feet; they were
turning dead, numbed by the water in which
they had been immersed so long without proper
protection.</p>

<p>But this was not all. No sooner had Drownlands
reached the slope of the embankment
than he became aware that the little assistance
rendered him by the frost was at an end. The
rush of water had broken up the gault of which
the bank was formed, was eating at every
moment farther into it, and widening the mouth
by which it poured from the bed of the river
upon the low reclaimed land. The moistened
marl was greasy under his feet. When he
slipped and endeavoured to catch at the bank,
his hands sank into the sodden clay, and the
tenacious matter held his fingers like glue. His
feet, moreover, went deep into the clay, and to
extract them was difficult.</p>

<p>It became apparent to Drownlands that he
must battle for his life against the current.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to assist himself in his ascent
by the staff of the flail, but this proved of no
help to him, as it sank with the pressure applied
to it in the glutinous mass. He strove to heave
himself up, and could not; his feet, dead with
cold, and, through their loss of sensation, no
longer able to feel the bottom, slipped from under
him. He could not extract his staff from the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>

marl. All he was able to do was to cling to it,
and pant and recover breath, and then make
another desperate effort forward.</p>

<p>The water, tearing through the fissure in the
bank, broke off masses of the clay, half frozen,
and whirled them down, and along with them
blocks of river ice that had broken up. It was
sometimes difficult to ascend the embankment,
the slope of which was steep, in the face of a
strong wind; it was a hundred times more difficult
now, when it had to be done against a
rushing torrent, and that of water which curdled
the blood in the veins, knotted the muscles with
cramp, and paralysed the sinews.</p>

<p>No thought of revenge on those who had cut
the bank now occupied the mind of Drownlands—no
thought of having the leak stopped. The
one absorbing consideration was how to escape
from the deadly-cold raging current.</p>

<p>Then a sharp cant of ice whirled down, cut
his knuckles and jarred his fingers, so that he
let go the flail with one hand, but seized it in
time with the other to save himself from being
swept away. He was carried off his feet, and in
trying to right himself drove one foot so deeply
into the marl, that, when he endeavoured to
pluck it forth, the tenacious matter held his boot
and tore it off his foot. The intensity of the
cold was, however, so great, that he was not
sensible of the loss. He looked up. The red
auroral light was still illumining the sky behind

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>

the bank. He held to the flail that was planted
in the clay. If that gave way, his hold on life
would be gone.</p>

<p>Now he saw above him a dark figure on the
bank, and he cried, 'Help! help!'</p>

<p>'Who calls there?'</p>

<p>'It is I—Ki Drownlands.'</p>

<p>The man made no effort to descend. He
folded his arms, and said slowly in harsh tones—</p>

<p>'I cannot help you. I am Ephraim Beamish.
You are prepared to testify against some twenty
of my comrades, and to send them to the
gallows. Which is of most worth, your life,
you Judas, or theirs?'</p>

<p>'Help! I will say nothing.'</p>

<p>'I cannot trust you,' said Beamish. 'Wretched
man, water was created of God to cleanse away
transgression. Go, wash thee and be clean—wash
thee and be free from thy sins.'</p>

<p>Then a torch flared above the bank. Mark
was there with Zita.</p>

<p>'Who is there? What is this?' Mark asked,
with an agitated voice. The blazing tarred
wood, sending up a golden burst of flame,
illumined the upturned countenance of Drownlands.
The struggling man raised his arm to
wipe the water and sweat from his eyes and
screen them from the brilliant light.</p>

<p>'It is the master,' said Zita. 'Save him,
Mark! Oh, do save him!'</p>

<p>Instantly, but with caution, Mark descended,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>

digging his heels deep into the marl at each
step, and held the torch aloft, wavering, guttering,
throwing out sparks in the wind. 'Give me
your hand,' said the young man.</p>

<p>The exhausted, desperate Drownlands withdrew
his arm from before his eyes.</p>

<p>In the burning wood was a copper nail, and
this now sent forth a lambent, grass-green flame,
in the light of which Drownlands' face was like
that of a corpse. The man, in his extreme peril
and desire for help, stretched forth his hand.</p>

<p>Then the wind blew the flame so that the face
of Mark was illumined. Suddenly Tiger Ki
snatched his hand back again.</p>

<p>'A Runham—no!'</p>

<p>He endeavoured by a frantic effort to ascend
the bank by his own efforts. There ensued a
terrible scene—the struggle of a well-nigh spent
man with the adverse elements to deliver himself
from his position. He fought with the water
and the clay, tossing a spray about him, pounding
with his feet, one shod, the other bare,
churning clay and water around him.</p>

<p>Failing to mount one step above where the flail
was rooted, he discontinued his profitless effort,
and, clinging with both hands to the stay, cried—</p>

<p>'Zita, I will owe life to you, or to none!'</p>

<p>Without a thought for herself, the girl leaped
to his aid.</p>

<p>In a moment his disengaged arm was round her.</p>

<p>'We may die—if we cannot live—together.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>'Let go!' shouted Mark, and laid hold of
Zita by the arm. 'Let go!'</p>

<p>'To you—never!'</p>

<p>Without consideration Mark drove the burning
torch against his hand that clasped the girl.</p>

<p>With a shriek Drownlands relaxed his hold.</p>

<p>At that moment, Ephraim, who had descended
carefully, had laid hold of the flail above where
Drownlands' hand had clutched it. He stooped,
and, exerting his full force from above, drew it
forth from the clay in which it was fast.</p>

<p>At once Drownlands slid away in the stream.
Still clinging to the flail, he was carried off his
feet, out of the range of light cast by the torch,
and under water.</p>

<p>'Go!' said Beamish, waving his hand over the
torrent. 'Go! thou accuser of thy brethren!
Go, wash away thy sins in the water that drowns
thee!'</p>

<p>He saw the flood before him glittering like
gold. He looked round. The gangers had
come—summoned by Kainie.</p>

<p>'Save him! save him!' cried Zita.</p>

<p>'Where is he?—who can say? Carried
forth into the outer darkness; rolled away in
the baptismal flood—who can say whither?'
answered Ephraim.</p>

<p>'No,' said one of the gangers. 'No help is
possible.'</p>

<p>'God have mercy on a sinful soul!' said
Ephraim.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THISTLES</p>

<p class="p1">THE trial of the rioters came on before a
Special Commission, that sat a few weeks
after the arrest of the men. The cutting of the
embankment after the arrest had greatly exasperated
minds against the unfortunate men
who were to take their trial, although they
themselves were guiltless in this matter. It
probably served to sharpen the sentences pronounced
upon them, as their judges shared the
general feeling that an example should be made
that would overawe the fen-men, and deter them
from future acts of lawlessness.</p>

<p>Judgment of death was passed on thirty-four
men, but only five were actually executed.
The sentence on nine was mitigated into transportation
for life, and that on the rest was
commuted to imprisonment for a term of years.</p>

<p>Ephraim Beamish was not taken. Mark succeeded
in effecting his escape from the Fens.
He supplied him with money, and Beamish

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>

took ship at Liverpool for the United States,
where he bought a farm, then turned backwoods
Baptist preacher, tired of that, returned to farm
life, and married Kainie, who went out to him.
She was a rich woman, and might have had
her pick of the young fen-farmers. She had
inherited everything that had belonged to her
uncle. But Kainie would have no one save Pip,
and as Pip could not come to her, she sold
Prickwillow to Mark, and went out to the man
of her choice in the New World.</p>

<p>Mark gave his half-sister a fair price for the
farm. The land had been seriously injured by
the inundation, and would have been more
seriously affected had not the bankers, summoned
by Kainie, been able rapidly and
effectually to stop the breach.</p>

<p>Mark was now a man of substance. When
he purchased Prickwillow, he united that estate
to Crumbland, and became one of the largest
landed proprietors in that portion of the Fens;
nevertheless, like his fellow-yeomen, he did not
affect to be a squire, but lived in sober fashion,
worked with his men, and worked harder than
any one of them. A popular man he was with
the labourer as with the farmer, for he was just
and kindly, and possessed unflagging good
spirits. He amassed money. Let his sons or
grandsons style themselves gentlemen, said he;
for his part, he was content to be plain Mark
Runham, farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>What is to be told concerning Zita?</p>

<p>The ill opinion formed of her had been due
mainly to the malicious and slanderous tongue
of Leehanna Tunkiss. Whatever had been said
against Zita was traceable to this source.</p>

<p>When it was discovered that Ki Drownlands
had made and executed his will on the very day
on which he died, and that in it he had constituted
his niece sole heiress of all he possessed,
and had not even mentioned the Cheap Jack
girl, the trust of the fen-folk in the word of
Mrs. Tunkiss failed. The housekeeper was
discredited and her stories disbelieved.</p>

<p>It was not long before Mark Runham made
Zita his wife, and the van, with all its goods,
was moved by a team of his horses to Crumbland.</p>

<p>There was one secret Zita retained locked in
her heart, and which she never revealed to Mark—the
events of the night when Ki Drownlands
and Jake Runham met on the embankment and
fought with the flails till Mark's father was cast
into the canal—there to perish. There was no
necessity for her to tell it. The guilty man had
died as had his foe—in the same water.</p>

<p>For many years recourse was had to the
stores of the van whenever the household was
in need of some article there in stock.</p>

<p>In the Fens, when a man requires to traverse
a considerable distance, he provides himself with
a leaping-pole, and makes for his destination in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>

a bee-line, clearing every watery obstruction
in his way.</p>

<p>The author now uses this privilege—takes
pole in hand, and, seeing the end before him,
makes for it. What does he first see after
having put down the pole and leaped?</p>

<p>A van. Surely the familiar Cheap Jack conveyance,
crawling along the drove on a summer's
day, drawn by an old horse that takes a few
steps, then pauses, breathes hard, looks behind
him with a peculiarly resolute expression in his
eye, and ignores absolutely every appeal, entreaty,
objurgation addressed to him, till he has
recovered his wind, when he goes on once more.</p>

<p>From within the van issue cheery children's
voices. Then some little heads appear, some
with auburn hair and brown eyes, others very
fair, and with eyes the colour of the sky.</p>

<p>'What the dickens is that there concern?'
asks a stranger, standing on the tow-path by the
Lark, who from his vantage-ground watches
the slow and intermittent progress of the van
on the drove.</p>

<p>'Lor' bless you!' answers a ganger going by.
'It's only them little Cheap Jackies taking a
drive.'</p>

<p>Again. What is the meaning of the noise
that issues from the coach-house? A shrill
voice is haranguing, then is broken in on by a
clamour of other voices.</p>

<p>Let us look within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>The van is there, in a house so boxed in as
to be inaccessible to poultry.</p>

<p>The front of the van is down. The red velvet
curtains, much faded, and the gold fringe, much
tarnished, are suspended in their proper places,
decorating the front. One boy is on the platform,
and is exhibiting his toys to his brothers
and sisters, and offering them for sale at extravagant
prices; then, abating his demands, he
assures them that he offers these articles for
absolutely the last time, and at the lowest price
which he will consent to receive.</p>

<p>Mark Runham returns from the farm.</p>

<p>'Zita,' says he, 'I want to see my little ones.
Where are they?'</p>

<p>'At their favourite amusement on a rainy
day.'</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p>'Playing at being Cheap Jacks. Mark, it is
in their blood.'</p>

<p>'Who is doing the selling today?'</p>

<p>'Our eldest—James,' answers Zita; 'and,
Mark, when James marries, we'll have out that
there epergne for the wedding breakfast.'</p>

<p>'That's a long way ahead,' answers Mark.</p>

<p>So it seemed to him. But again the novelist
uses his privilege, puts down the pole, and away
he goes with one great bound over a period of
several years, and finds himself suddenly alight
in the parlour of Crumbland. He sees before
him Mark, now a middle-aged man, broad in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>

shoulders and in beam, with ruddy cheeks
that are pretty full; and Zita, now a comely
matron.</p>

<p>Facing his father and mother, with some shyness
in his face, stands Jim, the hope of the
family, twirling his hat, and looking furtively in
his father's face, as he says—</p>

<p>'Father, give me the portion of goods that
falleth to me, and let me go.'</p>

<p>'Go? Go, Jim? Good gracious! what do
you mean? Whither do you want to go?'</p>

<p>'That is just it; nowhere in particular, and
yet somewhere.'</p>

<p>'But—leave home?'</p>

<p>'Yes, father, I want to be off and about.'</p>

<p>'Why, Jim, this is sheer delirium—tremenjous,
as your mother would say. There is Prickwillow
empty, waiting for you, whenever you
marry.'</p>

<p>'And the epergne for the breakfast-table,'
added Zita.</p>

<p>'I do not want to marry, father! The epergne
must wait, mother dear! I haven't found the
right one yet,' answered James, hanging his
head.</p>

<p>'But, good gracious! why should you go?
Have not I been kind to you? Have not you
been allowed your own way in all that is
right?'</p>

<p>'Never was there a better father,' answered
the young man, with emotion, 'and never, never

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>

a dearer, better mother! It is not that. I love
home. I love my parents and my brothers and
sisters. I dote on the baby. I love the Fens.
I cannot believe that any other portion of God's
world can be worth living in. I am sure none
will be more beautiful in my eyes than the fens
of Ely. Nevertheless, give me the portion of
goods that falleth to me, and let me go.'</p>

<p>'But for what do you want to be off?'</p>

<p>'Why, father, mother,' says the young man,
'I want to be a Cheap Jack. Ever since I was
a child I have loved to drive bargains.'</p>

<p>'Let him go,' says Zita. 'There are some
things we have never found a use for here.
There's that box of scents; there's the garden
syringe. It is a sad pity so much capital should
lie idle.'</p>

<p>'Father,' says the young man, 'I feel as
though I must go. I do not say I shall be a
Cheap Jack all my days.'</p>

<p>'Why, I had such grand views for you, Jim;
I thought I would send you to college, and I
hoped some day you might even try and get
into Parliament.'</p>

<p>'Mark,'—it is Zita who speaks,—'I was a
rambling girl once, a sort of a vagabond, going
over the country selling my goods; but I have
become stationary, like the van, stuck in the fen
peat. I have not stirred for many a year, and
have never desired to rove out of the Fens any
more. It will be the same with Jim. He has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>

it in his bones. It will do him an amazing
lot of good. He'll get to know the General
Public.'</p>

<p>'That is it, father,' says James. 'I seems as
if I never could be happy and easy in my mind
till I've done a stroke of business with that there
Public. And I sees my way to it. There's
abundance of thistles growing about the edges
of the drains. I wants to cut 'em down.'</p>

<p>'Well, cut 'em. That need not take you away.'</p>

<p>'Father, I wants to make the General Public
eat 'em, and pay for the privilege. I've heard
in my sleep a voice in my ear that I do believe
comes from the General Public, saying,
"Jim! Jim! give us thistles!" And the wind
always whistles to the same tune. And the
thunder rolling seems to be the voice of the
General Public, braying, "Give us thistles!"
And, father, even the very bees when they hum
about the flowers seem to convey to me in a
whisper the message, as from a lover, but it
comes from the General Public, "Give us thistles.
We are sick for thistledown. 'Tisn't bread we
wants—'tisn't meat—'tis thistledown." I can't
say exactly how I'll dispose of it to them,—whether
rolled up in pills, or stuffed in feather
beds,—but I know the Public will buy thistles
in any disguise. And then, father, think of the
profits.'</p>

<p>'Mark,' said Zita, 'let him go. Cheap-jacking
is an edication. It teaches a chap to know the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>

General Public, what to lay on his back, how to
tickle his ears, what you can make him swallow.
If you think of making Jim a mimber of Parliament,
there is no school, no college more suitable
than the Cheap Jack's van. Let him go, Mark.
He's a good boy—he'll come to no harm. He'll
settle down the better after it, and he'll enjoy
himself—"tremenjous."'</p>

writer, but an excellent fighter, and he took an active part in the defence of the town.
His narrative of the siege is acknowledged to be far superior to any other account.</p>

<p>WITH THE BOER FORCES.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Howard C. Hillegas</span>.
With 16 Illustrations. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<p>This highly interesting book is a narrative of the episodes of the Boer war by a correspondent
with the Boer army. Mr. Hillegas was present at many of the most
exciting and most dramatic episodes of the war. He was with the force which
attempted to relieve Cronje at Paardeberg, was present during a considerable
part of the siege of Ladysmith, at the battle of Colenso, at the surprise of Sanna's
Post. His book, written with dramatic vigour, is a spirited description of the
Boer methods, of their military strength, and contains vivid character sketches of
most of the Boer leaders with whom Mr. Hillegas was on terms of fairly intimate
friendship. This book, though written by one who sympathises with the Boers,
is permeated by a spirit of chivalry, and it contains little that can offend the most
sensitive of Englishmen. It throws a flood of light on many of the episodes
which have been mysterious, and explains the secrets of the many successes which
the Boers have won.</p>

<p>THE SOUL OF A CHRISTIAN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <span class="smcap">F. S. Granger</span>, M.A.,
Litt. D. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<p>Professor Granger abandons the conventional method of psychology by which the
individual is taken alone, and instead, he regards him as sharing in and contributing
to the catholic tradition. Hence the book deals not only with the average
religious life, but also with the less familiar experiences of the mystic, the visionary,
and the symbolist. These experiences furnish a clue to poetic creation in its
various kinds, and further, to the miracles which occur during times of religious
enthusiasm.</p>

will be the illustrations of the old houses, inns, and buildings, which Dickens
described, and which have now in many instances disappeared under the
touch of modern civilisation. Another valuable feature will be a series of
topographical and general notes to each book by Mr. F. G. Kitton. The books

<p>This book contains a full narrative by an

absorbing interest, and is the only complete
account which has appeared.</p>

<p>'The mantle of Archibald Forbes and G.

Mr. Atkins, who unites a singularly
graphic style to an equally rare faculty
of vision. In his pages we realise the
meaning of a modern campaign with the

are written with a sustained charm of
diction and ease of manner that are no
less remarkable than the sincerity and
vigour of the matter which they set
before us.'—<i>World.</i></p>

provided it be presented in the true spirit
of Christian faith. The amplifications
of the Scripture narrative are often conceived
with high poetic insight, and this

a lofty and not inadequate paraphrase

<p>'That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that may
be very generally accepted. His views of life are fresh and vigorous, his language
pointed and characteristic, the incidents of which he makes use are striking and original,
his characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional people, are drawn and
coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his descriptions of scenes and scenery are
painted with the loving eyes and skilled hands of a master of his art, that he is always
fresh and never dull, and it is no wonder that readers have gained confidence in his
power of amusing and satisfying them, and that year by year his popularity widens.'—<i>Court

<p>This edition contains parallel passages from
the Eudemian Ethics, printed under the
text, and there is a full commentary, the
main object of which is to interpret difficulties
in the light of Aristotle's own
rules.</p>

its author's learning and critical acumen,
and which cannot but prove heartily welcome
to all classes of Greek scholars.'—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>'It forms a valuable addition to the existing
literature on the subject.'—<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>'We must content ourselves with saying, in
conclusion, that we have seldom, if ever,
seen an edition of any classical author in
which what is held in common with other

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
